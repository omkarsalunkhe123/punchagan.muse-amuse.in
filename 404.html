How long did the whole ride take? Was it really hard? Why couldn\u0026rsquo;t you finish the ride? So, you do really need a support vehicle? How much did the support vehicle cost you? Did you carry your own bikes? Did the flights charge you for the bikes? Would you recommend me to carry my bike? What cycle spares/tools did you carry? What sort of preparation did you do for this ride? Can you share your ride plan? What was a typical day during the trip, like? What was the most enjoyable part of the ride? What was the most challenging part of the ride? You keep saying it was cold, how cold was it really? Did you meet any interesting people en-route? Would you do this again? If yes, which part of the year would you do it? If not, what other routes would you try? Do you have any pictures that you can share?  So, you cycled from Manali to Leh? Well, Not really. We cycled from Kalath to Whiskey Nala \u0026ndash; a distance of 280km \u0026ndash; which is about 60% of the Manali-Leh route.\nWho is \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo;? Vivek and I were on the bikes. Shabu was our guide helping us fix our bikes and fixing up our meals, but more than anything else, ensuring that we don\u0026rsquo;t freeze to death. Susheel was driving along and cheering us.\nHow did you decide to do this? Vivek and I were going to Coorg with Prats and Addy, and Prats told us a whole lot of stories of her adventures in the mountains. Not sure how bicycles came into the picture, but as soon as they did, both of us got really excited about it. This was on some sort of a bucket list for me, ever since I read Vatsap\u0026rsquo;s cycling story many years ago. Soon, after we were back in town, the ball was set rolling\u0026hellip;\nWhat is the maximum elevation you cycled to? We started off at around 1.8km and went up to about 5km in a span of 5 days. We also spent a day in Manali, getting our cycles fixed and acclimatizing. You can see the elevation profile here.\nHow long did the whole ride take? Our plan was to finish the whole distance in 7 days. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t get to our designated camp on the 5th day, and had to use the support car to get to camp before it got dark. We decided to end the ride once we took our bikes off the road.\nWas it really hard? Why couldn\u0026rsquo;t you finish the ride? We expected the primary challenges to be:\n the altitude and lack of oxygen the fatigue from riding day after day after day\u0026hellip;  But, cold played a much bigger role than we thought it would. As we got higher and higher, it got so cold that we spent a significant amount of energy and brain cycles on trying to fight the cold, rather than enjoying the views or pushing ourselves to keep going despite the non-cold-related discomfort.\nSo, you do really need a support vehicle? Not really, if you were riding in better weather or were better prepared. The Manali to Leh route usually has a lot of temporary shops setup during the season, where you could crash, if it was too cold to just crash in your tent. Since, we were going after the season had almost ended, many of these shops were no longer open, and having the support car turned out to be quite useful on the last day.\nHow much did the support vehicle cost you? It turned out to be quite an expense for something we originally didn\u0026rsquo;t have in mind. We spent about 20k on the vehicle, fuel and the driver\u0026rsquo;s fee. We also paid our guide + cook + bicycle expert, separately.\nDid you carry your own bikes? Yes.\n Flew from Bengaluru to Delhi Took a bus from Delhi to Manali Carried the bikes on the support car from Whiskey Nala to Leh Flew back from Leh to Delhi  Did the flights charge you for the bikes? The carrier (IndiGo) from BLR to DEL charged us a handling fees of Rs. 1000. The carrier (Vistara) on the return journey didn\u0026rsquo;t.\nWould you recommend me to carry my bike? You could find bikes on rent, both in Manali and Leh, for about 500 to 700 per day. It would cost about 5-7k, based on how you plan your ride, to rent a bike. You\u0026rsquo;ll have to make arrangements to get the bike returned back to the place you rent it from \u0026ndash; this can get a little tricky.\nIf you already own a bike, and can it packed in a proper box, I would highly recommend that. The derailleurs, the shifters, and other such moving parts need to be well packed and guarded. Use a box or a cycling bag to put it in. Get professional help from a cycle retailer nearby, if required. This is one thing you cannot take any chances on, or your whole trip may be jeopardized!\nWe hadn\u0026rsquo;t paid enough attention to packing our bikes, and one of our bikes took quite some beating on the way to Delhi. On the way back, we managed to get the bike packed in a box and it was a breeze.\nWhat cycle spares/tools did you carry? We were sort of ill prepared in this department. We only had the following:\n Hand pump Puncture kit Spare tubes (2 nos.) Allen key set  Based on advice from Shabu, I think you should also take these things:\n Brake cables Gear cables Spare tyre (1 Nos.) Brake shoes/pads Few spokes Chain oil  What sort of preparation did you do for this ride? We did a handful of 50-100km rides on weekends before this one. The only real elevation training/trial that we did was the Kalhatti climb, one weekend before this ride. This turned out to be pretty useful, and we found all the other climbs during this ride much less steeper than some of the Kalhatti ones.\nCan you share your ride plan?

What was a typical day during the trip, like?  Wake up between 7 and 8, depending on when you can see/feel the warm sun. Laze in bed if you woke up too early, and the sun hasn\u0026rsquo;t yet warmed the place up. Eat porridge, and a few slices of bread with peanut butter. Pack ourselves up in as many layers of clothing as we can, while still being able to pedal. Check the bikes for any loose/fallen-off/broken parts, blow, etc. Start pedaling away - usually between 9 and 10. It\u0026rsquo;s too cold to start earlier. Keep adjusting the clothing, based on how cold/warm it is, and the wind chill. Keep munching, or sipping on some water (plain or mixed with some energizer). Continue pedaling, and start looking at the milestones a little more carefully. Lunch is on our mind, already. Lunch at around 1:30pm - usually, a couple of boiled eggs, and a potato. May be a chocolate, and some Frooti. More pedaling. The kilometers start getting harder, the chill is getting harsher. Huff and puff, and reach our camp for the day. Hi-fives! We\u0026rsquo;d try and reach the camp while there is still some sunlight there to keep us warm. Stretch it out, and switch into dry, warm clothes. Grab a quick snack - whole packets of biscuits would just disappear, alongside some tea. Talk, walk around, ponder about life, think about the day that\u0026rsquo;s been, think about the day that is to come, and all that jazz. Eat dinner - dal and rice, mostly. Sleep like logs. Unless, there\u0026rsquo;s a rat in the room that\u0026rsquo;s attacking our dry fruits.  What was the most enjoyable part of the ride?  I really enjoyed sitting at Deepak Tal, and just looking at the clear water The climb to Baralacha La was the most challenging part of the ride. We could see that the weather was really bad in all the peaks around us, and it was getting really cold. Briefly, it was even snowing very lightly and we could see tiny snow flakes floating in front of us. The feeling of reaching the top of passes was quite thrilling, for both Rohtang and Baralacha La. Nakee La, not so much, since we still had about 30km ahead of us to finish the day. It was humbling to see all the BRO folks working to keep the roads open and functional! A big salute to them! Each time we had a truck or some bikers pass by, we would wave at them or show thumbs up, and it would give us some additional energy to keep pushing ahead. The tree covered road in Sissu was just mind blowingly beautiful, with all the trees golden and yellow, preparing for the fall. It was also nice to turn 30, in the hills. Vivek tried to make it as special, for me, as he could.  What was the most challenging part of the ride? The cold. (See, the answer on why we didn\u0026rsquo;t finish the ride).\nYou keep saying it was cold, how cold was it really? On the night we camped at Sarchu, the water in our bottles and unwashed cups had frozen. We had gone to sub zero temperatures on many nights, it looks like. The winds during the day were quite chilly, and got worse as we gained altitude.\nDid you meet any interesting people en-route?  We met a guy from Slovenia who has been taking a couple or so months off for the past 10 years. He was riding around with a 55kg weighing bike for the past 3 weeks, and was going from Leh to Manali, when we met him. He had a lot of stories to tell \u0026ndash; including recommending that we go cycling in Iceland, and enjoy watching the Northern lights from hot water baths.\n Shabu himself had a lot of stories to tell about all the people he had taken on this ride - from guys with a $6k bike to a 70 year old doing the route his 4th time to the guy who would eat only olive oil mixed in rice to safeguard his tummy, and more!\n All the aachos and aamas in the shops/guest houses/etc that we went to were really nice to us. Most of the folks in the shops were planning to leave in a few days after we had met them since it had gotten really cold.\n We had our camp-site at Marhi in the compound of a HP state guest house.

Next time!\nWould you do this again? May be. We feel like we got a taste of the challenge of the ride, and the rest of the route wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be anymore challenging than what we already saw, if we did it in better weather. But, the better weather would also mean more traffic and noise on the road.\nIf yes, which part of the year would you do it? Late August to mid-September might be a better time. We\u0026rsquo;d also need to look out for rains and land-slides, though.\nIf not, what other routes would you try?  Cycling around Europe sounds like a fun thing to try Rides in the western ghats and/or Kerala seem promising A Tour of Meghalaya was something a friend suggested Pushing that a little more, ride all the way to Singapore/Indonesia, starting at home  Do you have any pictures that you can share?

It felt like a fresh breath of air amongst all the other Indian data driven journalism that I have been coming across in the recent past.\nThe visualizations are a lot more interactive than some of the other Indian publications. These remind me of NYT\u0026rsquo;s interactives, which are amongst the best you\u0026rsquo;d see, while more often than not exploring data in the Indian context. I really like that they explore a variety of ways of doing these visualizations, and don\u0026rsquo;t just fit the data into one of the many standard options available in a visualization library.\nIt feels like they are willing to take their time to do these visualizations, and are willing to collect data from multiple sources, and combine multiple datasets to tell a story. I also like the fact that the visualizations and the articles are more open-ended, allowing users to interact with and explore the data, rather than trying to come up with an article full of conclusions with a click-baity title. The fact that one of the sections is called Just for Fun speaks to me.\nThe data and the code used in most of these interactives is open and available on GitHub, which is nice!\nOn the whole, I think they are doing pretty good work, and I shall be on the lookout for even better stuff from them. I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;ll pick up a thing or two from their work, in my projects. Hopefully, other teams doing similar work will also learn from there and produce more good stuff for greedy readers like me.\n",

     "content": "I wanted to try using a dialog box/pop-up window as a prompt to remind me to periodically make journal entries. I had the following requirements:\n Simple, light-weight dialog box that allows text of arbitrary length Ability to launch the dialog from the shell Ability to have some placeholder or template text, each time the dialog is shown Save the input text to a specific org-mode file Write as little code of my own, as possible, to do this  I had initially thought about using a tool like zenity, or write a simple dialog box in Python using Qt, wx or even tk, and then yank the input text at the desired location. This probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have turned out to be too hard, but getting things to look and work exactly the way I wanted would have required more code than I was willing to write or maintain.\nAfter avoiding doing this for a while, I finally realized that I could simply use Emacs with a new frame with the appropriate dimensions, and with the correct file/buffer open to the desired location. This would\n eliminate the need for me to write the UI myself eliminate the need to do text manipulation in code, to yank it at the right place, in the right form. By directly opening up the editor at the required location, the onus is on me (as a text inputting user) to put it in, the way I want it. additionally provide me the comfort of being able to write with the full power of Emacs - keybindings and all that jazz. let me leverage elisp to do essentially whatever I want with the buffer being displayed as the dialog box.  I ended up with a command that looks something like this\nemacsclient -c -n\\ -F '((title . \u0026quot;Title\u0026quot;) (left . (+ 550)) (top . (+ 400)) (width . 110) (height . 12))'\\ -e '(pc/open-journal-buffer)'   This worked pretty nicely, except for the fact that with gnome-shell, the pop-up frame doesn\u0026rsquo;t always appear raised. It often gets hidden in the Emacs windows group, and the whole idea of the pop-up acting as a reminder goes for a toss! But, thanks to this Ask Ubuntu post, I could fix this pretty easily.\nemacsclient -c -n\\ -F '((title . \u0026quot;Title\u0026quot;) (left . (+ 550)) (top .

     "content": "I came across a couple of fun word clouds, and felt like generating a word cloud for my blog content to get a sense of the major themes on my blog, over the years.\nWith some simple Python code, I was able to parse the blog and get the word frequency over the years. I then used a modified version of this d3 example to generate a word cloud.\nUsing all the words used in each year to generate the word-cloud, made it very noisy. So, I switched to using only the top 50 words for each year.\n The word cloud doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem very useful or insightful, but was fun to generate. Each year\u0026rsquo;s cloud seems to have some words that gives me a sense of some major events/themes for that year, though it may not be very apparent to anybody other than me.\nThe years which have a lot of posts have clear winners, but the winning words are quite generic. For example, 2007 has words like \u0026ldquo;life\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;time\u0026rdquo;, etc., as winners. To try to get rid of the generic words in the word cloud, I tried a quick and dirty tf-idf based word-cloud, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t really seem to help.\n I might get back to this later, to try and improve the tf=idf word cloud. There are also other problems, like code-blocks in posts contributing variable names, urls contributing domain names, etc.\nAlso, a simple line chart of the usage of tags vs. year might give a better sense of the themes in the blog by year, even though it may not look as fancy as a word-cloud.\n",

You can find an interactive version here \u0026ndash; hovering over each flooding, shows some more information about the event.\n The graphic uses flooding related data from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory The data for 2017 events is not up-to date. It is very likely that there is some missing data, and some inaccuracies in the data. 1987, for instance, doesn\u0026rsquo;t show the Bihar flood. The flood severity is indicated by the color of each shape Each shape represents the geographic flood extents - based on information obtained from news sources. The data for India map shape is obtained from this topojson collection  It is interesting to look at the severity definitions here \u0026ndash; the extreme class floods, for instance, are defined to be those that have an estimated recurrence interval of over 100 years. In a span of 30 odd years, there are a whole bunch of regions which have been affected by extreme floods. Yet another case in point showing that the climate change shit has really hit the roof!\nCode I used ogr2ogr to convert the shape file obtained from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory\nogr2ogr -f geoJSON data/floods.json FloodArchive_region.shp  This file turned out to be about 6MB. I created a file with only Indian floods by parsing the json file.\nimport json with open('floods.json', encoding='latin-1') as f: data = json.load(f) india_features = [ feature for feature in data['features'] if feature['properties']['COUNTRY'] == 'India' ] data['features'] = india_features # FIX some names in the data NAME_FIXES = [ ('Tropical Storm K', 'Tropical Storm Komen'), ('Tropical Storm Hudhug', 'Tropical Storm Hudhud'), ] for feature in india_features: for name, fix in NAME_FIXES: cause = feature['properties']['MAINCAUSE'] if name in cause: feature['properties']['MAINCAUSE'] = cause.replace(name, fix) with open('india-floods.json', 'w', encoding='latin-1') as f: json.dump(data, f)  The visualization code itself is about a hundred odd lines of d3 code.\n",

So, here we go with a not-so-useful post showing how frequently I have been posting to this blog, to get a sense of how long this break has been in comparison to other silences in the past.\nNeither the code below, nor the plots are very insightful. But, I just hope this will get me started on the path to blogging more regularly. See you around!\nParsed post content I wrote some code to parse the content of the blog, and each post object looks something like this:\n{'date': datetime.datetime(2010, 3, 17, 18, 30, tzinfo=\u0026lt;UTC\u0026gt;), 'draft': False, 'tags': ['blab', 'life', 'poem'], 'title': 'Just another bunch'} Post count: 190  Post frequency by year import pandas posts = pandas.DataFrame(posts) counts = posts['date'].groupby(posts['date'].dt.year).count() plot = counts.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(8, 6)) plot.set_xlabel('Years') plot.set_ylabel('# of posts')   Post frequency by month # Add a DatetimeIndex to the Dataframe posts.index = pandas.DatetimeIndex(posts['date'].values) counts = posts['date'].groupby(pandas.TimeGrouper('M')).count() ax = counts.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(12, 8)) n = 5 ticks = ax.xaxis.get_ticklocs() labels = counts.index.strftime('%Y-%m') labels = ax.xaxis.set_ticklabels(labels[::n]) ticks = ax.xaxis.set_ticks(ticks[::n]) ax.set_xlabel('year-month') ax.set_ylabel('# of posts')   Work-flow I jumped onto the hugo bandwagon too.\nI was totally impressed by how fast it is, and have been meaning to try it out for a while, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t impressed with the built-in org-mode support it came with. This changed when I finally came across the ox-hugo package that does a wonderful job of exporting blog posts from an org file to hugo\u0026rsquo;s markdown format. I have contributed a couple of patches to it, to make it work better for myself and hopefully for others too.\nAlso, for this post, I used ob-ipython with the enhancements from scimax and it has really made the whole experience quite enjoyable.\nAmong other things, I think one of the reasons for those peaks in the second half of 2010, was having a smooth work-flow. My current work-flow feels pretty nice too, and I hope it\u0026rsquo;ll reduce some of the friction in writing more posts.\nOnwards!\n",

     "content": " TL;DR\n Am I saying India doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a caste problem?\nNo, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a HUGE problem!\n Are these articles on Google Trends and Sindhu\u0026rsquo;s caste useful at all?\nJust more click-baits and no useful contribution to the discussion on caste.\n  First of all, congratulations to PV Sindhu on making it to the finals and giving the world number one a hard fight!\nThis post, though, is not a celebratory one. I read this article \u0026ndash; While PV Sindhu fought hard for a medal, many Indians googled her caste \u0026ndash; by the News Minute thanks to a re-tweet by TM Krishna. I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have paid much attention to it, if not for the retweet by TMK.\nCaste is a huge problem for the country, and if you still like to pretend it isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ndash; read this for a start. I\u0026rsquo;m not surprised that some people searched for Sindhu\u0026rsquo;s caste while she was battling it out at Rio. But, some people also searched for Badminton rules, and others for Sania Mirza! What surprises me is that the article doesn\u0026rsquo;t try to put the data in a context at all. Nor do I understand the contribution this article makes to the discussion on caste.\n I played around a little more with these search terms and Google Trends, and here are a few things that I thought were worth sharing.\nIndian trends First of all, the article says \u0026ldquo;Many Indians\u0026rdquo;, and gives off cumulative month-wise numbers (UPDATE [2016-08-21 Sun 12:15]: which are so wrong! See Sankrant Sanu\u0026rsquo;s excellent article on India Facts). But, what does it really mean?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know if anybody actually wrote about how many people actually followed the match, but Sindhu actually managed to get a whole lot of people interested!\n More people searched for PV Sindhu than the daily average number of searches (not hits) for Facebook and very close to the daily number of searches for Porn \u0026ndash; two of the biggest things Internet is allegedly used for. Can you see the red line at the bottom? That is the number of people who actually searched for Sindhu\u0026rsquo;s caste \u0026ndash; a tiny blip.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look. Here\u0026rsquo;s a plot of some of the other auto suggest terms + badminton rules \u0026amp; courts compared to Sindhu\u0026rsquo;s name.\n Nothing other than badminton rules (which is at about 1% of max. searches) is even visible, clearly.\nSo, these other terms (wiki \u0026amp; caste being auto-suggested ones) are nowhere near the actual number of searches being made for PV Sindhu\u0026rsquo;s name alone.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get rid of the name graph to get a closer look at the other terms.\n  The maximum number of people searching for Sindhu\u0026rsquo;s caste is at about a fifth of the maximum number of people searching for badminton rules. Interpreting it is upto you. But, I\u0026rsquo;m not surprised knowing how significant caste has been in our society. Also, notice that searches for wiki and caste fall off more gradually than the searches for the rules which peak while the game is being played and watched.\n Unsurprisingly, a bulk of the searches appear to be coming from Andhra and Telangana. Notice that the other states are searching more for the rules or her wiki page.\n    Do you notice that the red (caste), blue (wiki) and violet (images) lines following a similar trend, until the last few hours? What do you think is happening there? It\u0026rsquo;s the shitty click baits working! Look at the trends from ~8:30AM to ~12:30AM below \u0026ndash; the red has spread to other states as well!    And this is how it looks by the evening (17:00-21:00). Well done, folks! The click bait articles totally succeeded!   If you are wondering how much effect the auto suggestions are having in suggesting people to try searching for caste, I don\u0026rsquo;t think that is much because wiki and images are the other auto-suggest terms, with no such surges in the number of searches.\nTrends from the Telugu states We could see that the two Telugu states were more worried about the caste, than the rest of the country. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how abnormal they are.\n  You can definitely see the red line more prominently. In case of Andhra the peak searches for caste are at about 5% of the name searches. A statistically significant difference from the rest of the country.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s zoom in at the auto-suggest terms alone.\n  Woah, Andhra is definitely quite an aberration from the rest of the country. From about 1/5th of the maximum number of searches for rules, the maximum number of caste searches jumps to about twice. Telangana also is different, but much less so.\nTamil Nadu\u0026rsquo;s trends below for comparison. You can\u0026rsquo;t help noticing the last few hours, can you?\n NOTE: The trends and screen-shots for the states are slightly more recent than the others.\nConclusion Without a context, I don\u0026rsquo;t really see the point of these \u0026ldquo;news\u0026rdquo; articles. It seems more click-bait-y than useful to me.\nIf you still feel many Indians were searching for Sindhu\u0026rsquo;s caste, while she was fighting it out, go ahead and play with Google trends here. Add/remove terms, change the time and location filters. Some terms that could be interesting to add to the comparison are: Kashmir, Independence day, Facebook.\nLater, I looked at the search results and then found that this article wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only one like it. I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother to read the others, but I really hope at least some of them are talking sense. Is any of them really trying to contribute to the discussion on caste, meaningfully?\nAlso, the actual search results don\u0026rsquo;t seem to give useful answers to the folks so curious about Sindhu\u0026rsquo;s caste. I hope none of these articles are trying to help them out.\nFinally, if you are using Google Trends to write an article, Danny Page has some really good advice.\nThanks to Kamal, baali and 9 for reading and reviewing drafts of this. Errors mine, obviously.\n",

A friend said that she liked the fact that the Slack article preview had the reading time from Medium in it. She could decide whether or not she wanted to read the poem or any other article at that moment.\nThis gave me the idea for a reading time extension for my browser, or my feed reader or my bookmarks \u0026ndash; my reading list. The first version should be able to compute or extract the reading time for an article or a tab in my browser, and index them. I want to be able to specify the amount of time I will be able to spend reading, and be presented with something from my reading list. I think this would help with scheduling the reading of longer articles, and also to actually help me get through my reading list.\nReading time estimates that use heuristics based on word-count may not really work, and may do more harm than good.

I had to step out of the house and take a walk to meet someone, etc.\nI ended up getting ideas during the walks, which significantly changed and simplified how I would\u0026rsquo;ve implemented things, if not for those breaks. Even if I did end up zeroing down to those solutions, I am pretty sure it would\u0026rsquo;ve taken a couple of not-so-good attempts and much longer than it did.\nContext switches are usually considered to be expensive for programmers, but taking a break at the exact time when I had all the required context loaded into my head seemed to help.

As my bit of contribution to this, below is a re-hash of some good advice from the internet on why you should give a talk, and how to submit a good proposal.\nWhy?  You needn\u0026rsquo;t be an expert on a topic. If you have enough experience about something to help make the next person\u0026rsquo;s experience with it better, you are good.\n Its a great way to find people who are interested in the same things as you are and to get to talk to them. If you are an introvert, you should definitely be speaking!\n Proposing and giving a talk is about thinking about something hard enough to refine your thoughts, and being able to explain it to others. Its a useful skill to hone.\n  How?  Talks are entertainment. Pick a topic that you are excited about and fascinated by. Let it be a general topic that will have a significant number of people interested in it.\n What you want the attendees to be telling their friends about your talk, after they go back. Make it the objective of your talk.\n Submit a complete, clear and compelling proposal. Show the reviewers that you are willing to put in the effort to prepare for and to give a great talk. Here are a bunch of proposals to see and learn from.\n Submit an outline along with your talk. Show the talk can be delivered in the given time and will be interesting. Include an indication of how much time you intend to spend on each part of your talk.\n Choose a good title. The title is what catches the attention of your audience when they are trying to pick a talk. Avoid buzz words.\n Get feedback. Like any writing, feedback can be helpful at all stages \u0026ndash; brainstorm while choosing topics to getting critique on the full abstract.\n Convince the reviewers that you can give a well-rehearsed and entertaining \u0026ndash; link to previous talks you\u0026rsquo;ve given, include links to any testimonials you\u0026rsquo;ve received from your audience, etc. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a previously recorded talk, give a small talk to your friends or colleagues and have it recorded.\n  References  PyCon US has some good advice on how to submit a proposal and most of it is generic enough for you to use for PyCon India, or any other conference.\n These posts (1 2 and more) by Jesse Davis are so so good!\n I also liked \u0026ldquo;The Talk on Talks\u0026rdquo; by Zach Holman.\n  ",

It has made it a lot simpler to make some of the things I used to, because its non-stick. And it has vastly expanded the possibilities of things I can make, by virtue of being flat and wide based. The pan is such a great addition to my kitchen paraphernalia, and it adds a new dimension to the kind of things I can make. I\u0026rsquo;m not here to write a user review for it, though.\nWhat are such tools in other things that you do, that drastically changed the way you did something, or added a new dimension to the kinds of things you could do, tools that make you feel like you have a new super-power? Learning to write Python (after starting off with C) seemed to give me so much power allowing me to focus on the problem, rather than fussing over the low level details.

When creating a new post, it prompts for a title, and creates a file for the post.\nOften I\u0026rsquo;m starting off with only a vague idea that needs to be fleshed out before it can be published (or discarded). It is quite difficult to come up with a title at this stage. I just want to start a draft and write things down!\nI could use a \u0026ldquo;draft-title\u0026rdquo; and change it after finishing a post, but this feels tedious \u0026ndash; requires 3 steps \u0026ndash; change the title, post filename and post slug. The last two steps are optional, really, but I feel they are important especially when the original title is very different from the new one.\nBeing forced to come up with a title before anything else, feels tedious and, adds to the effort required to start off a new post. I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t really be worrying about the effort required to change the title of an unwritten post, but it happens subconsciously.\nTo work around this, I now have a \u0026ldquo;re-title utility\u0026rdquo; in my editor that takes care of all the tedious details. I can start with a random title, like Draft-1, and change it when I\u0026rsquo;m done with the post. I feel this is going to lead to a lot more drafts, at the very least, if not published posts.\nAnother work-flow related thing I came across recently was @Malabarba\u0026rsquo;s issue on CIDER (an IDE for Clojure in Emacs). The REPL takes a while to startup and this caused him to not use CIDER for running tests, if there wasn\u0026rsquo;t an already open REPL.\nThe tedium that people feel effects how they use the tool. Not surprisingly, making tedious-feeling tasks a breeze with the tool also effects how and how much they use it. Subtle variations in a work-flow could make or break it. How do you discover such potential work-flow make-or-break-ers? I think, these things would help:\n Use the tool yourself (dog-food) Talk to (or watch!) people using your tool Look at work-flows in other similar tools Thinking explicitly about various scenarios and simplifying or improving work-flows  I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear examples of this, and any ideas or thoughts you may have on identifying and fixing such things!\n",

Of the 14 people who stayed until the last day, 5 of us were in a Sumo and 9 were in a Tempo Traveller van. We had already said our goodbyes when we got into the vehicles, but we happened to stop at the same place for lunch \u0026ndash; thanks to the drivers. Daksh, a 10 year old who breezed through his first trek, came running to us from the van and hugged Arvind who had just finished his second back to back trek and has plans for 2 more next month. Both of them were beaming happiness. This pretty much sums up the past 5 days in the trek! The rest of the trip was just descending further and getting into civilization, reminiscing all the fun, catching up with civilization and slipping back into the bustle and the noise of normal life, with more goodbyes.\nI had been travelling for about 2 weeks before the trek, crawling up slowly from Bangalore to Delhi, and then spent a couple of days in Mukteshwar after reading about it somewhere on the internet. I enjoyed the calm of the hills, and the warmth of a family with who I happened to stay with. But, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t done. I really wanted to see the beautiful night sky filled with stars, and gaze into the distance at snow capped mountains and be overwhelmed by their grandness. I knew I had to go further into the hills. I came back to Delhi, to get more winter/cold wear and to go back with a better plan. I mentioned to baali the idea of heading off either to Kashmir or somewhere in the north-east by myself using public transport and local help, or going on a trek with a group. He recommended India Hikes, and helped me find a trek that fit my requirements \u0026ndash;\n starts as soon as possible, but isn\u0026rsquo;t too long \u0026ndash; I had to be back in Bangalore in a week. had opportunities to enjoy \u0026ndash; great views of the snow capped mountains and the night sky. not too hard \u0026ndash; I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to spend all my time thinking about where and how I was going to put my next step. I wanted a relaxed trek with time to look around and take in the beauty.  There were only a couple of treks that seemed to fit the bill. baali pushed me and got me registered for the Deoriatal-Chandrashila trek. I got my \u0026ldquo;trek uniform\u0026rdquo; from Decathlon and packed my bags for the trek \u0026ndash; I only had a couple of days to do this. I was sorta nervous about all this because I really dislike cold weather, but baali gave me loads of moral support to take the first steps.\n\nThis post is an attempt to record this trek for my future self. If you\u0026rsquo;d like detailed documentation for the trek, see India Hikes\u0026rsquo; documentation.\nThe Base-camp I reached Haridwar in a bus from Delhi, way before the scheduled time to meet everyone else. I walked around the town before sunrise, reached the station and waited for trekkers to start trickling in. The base camp, Sari, was about an 8 hour ride from Haridwar, that I spent mostly sleeping \u0026ndash; it was quite hot! Much hotter than I expected. And I started to feel comfortable about possibly not having enough clothing for the cold. When packing, baali and I were trying to make a sensible trade-off between the amount of stuff I carried and not feeling uncomfortably cold. He had the experience of one-trek and was leaning towards the lighter-backpack side, and this being my first trek I wanted to be heavily on the extra-clothing-for-cold side. The final state of my backpack left behind a slight worry in the back of my mind, which kept coming to the fore from time to time, until the bus ride.\n\nThe base camp turned out to be a small lodge sort of a thing with cozy rooms for the trekkers and India Hikes trek leads, guides and other support staff. The views from here weren\u0026rsquo;t very different than what I could see from Mukteshwar. There weren\u0026rsquo;t really any snow peaks in our view and there was a lot of lush green and the Sari village in view. We were received by similing faces of the support staff and trek leads, welcoming us on the trek. The comforting camaraderie would be a feature throughout the rest of the trek! Our group had some people who had done treks with India Hikes before, and all the interactions around me were giving me a good feeling of joining a great community. Everyone other than me seemed to know everyone else, yet new people were made to feel comfortable and I felt totally at home.\n\nKamal, our trek lead, briefed us about the trek and wished us good luck for the trek. The thing I loved the most about the briefing was our guide Dhan Singh explaining to us that India Hikes aims to make high altitude trekking more generally accessible and that we should treat this trek as a learning experience to be able to go on treks by ourselves with friends and/or family! It was going to be 4 days of learning about all sorts of things from symptoms of AMS and the horrors of it to using micro spikes and different walking styles on snow \u0026amp; ice! It was also the beginning of 4 days of listening to so many stories of various different treks, especially Roopkund.\nDeoriatal After some lovely breakfast, we packed and set out for what was going to be a short hike up, to Deoria tal \u0026ndash; lake created by the Gods. Beautiful meadows, a lake and glorious views of the snow-capped mountains in the backdrop. Picture perfect! This was exactly the kind of thing I was looking for, I thought, when I ended up at Mukteshwar! This was just what I wanted from the trek. Apart from the gorgeous night skies.\nThis was the best part of the trek, for me. Even more than the summit.\n\nThe rest of the day was spent walking around the camp-site, and taking in as much of the beauty as we could. We walked up to a couple of view points that gave better views of the mountains and walked around the lake, enjoying the calmness. We could see Chandrashila, the peak we were going to summit in 3 days from the second view point. Also, the Rhododendron covered slopes were a sight to watch!\n\nPlaying Frisbee with the trekkers and cricket with cooks and other support staff taking care of people at the camp, along with the trek lead and guides added more physical activity that I enjoyed quite a bit. The sport, apart from getting to hang around with people and getting to know them, also helped me keep myself warm, through out the day, without too much clothing.\nThe camp site had a few other camps, some of whom we interacted with and others who we didn\u0026rsquo;t talk to but were spotted near all of the rest of the camps we were going to have in the next 3 days.\n\nWe had some story telling, singing and oxy-meter readings in the dining tent before yet another yummy meal. My oxygen levels were good, but my pulse was close to 90. It had come back down to 60 during the next couple of days. I wonder if my body was still acclimatising or if it was signs of some of the anxiousness that was going to hit me later in the night. I went back to sleep after fooling around with the other post dinner, till about 10 o\u0026rsquo; clock. I fell asleep quickly, but I started feeling extremely anxious and uneasy, to the point of me even thinking of hiking back down to the base camp. I\u0026rsquo;m still not sure what it was that made me so uneasy, and thankfully I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the feeling again during the rest of the trek. I was able to ease back into sleep with some reading.\nI would definitely think of Deoria Tal, whenever I felt the need for a calm amidst some awe-inspiring beauty, without trekking too much.\n\nTala or Rohini Bugyal We woke up to a clear sky and a serene lake that drew me to go and sit by its side, until breakfast. We got packed up and prepared for what was going to be the longest day, in terms of the time spent hiking and distance covered. The hike was going to be through a forest trail, with lots of Rhododendron trees and dozens of different bird species. This stretch of the trek also had some of the views I liked the most.\nThe hike was relaxed and we had our packed lunches after about half way through the trek. The lunch, like all other meals, was so yummy that I regretted carrying such a small box. Ankit, Abhirut and Shyamlee with bigger boxes, kindly shared some of their food with me.\n\nNear the end of the hike we bumped into Tanmoy \u0026ndash; another Trek lead with India hikes who was going to meet us at our next night\u0026rsquo;s base camp. He was mapping the trek route and had covered our 3 day trail in a single day. The next night at Martoli he would tell us his story of how he got into trekking and inspire us with them!\nThe evening was a musical one. After our daily dose of Himalayan stories, it was great to hear trek lead Kamal, sing some popular numbers with so much feeling. Pooja and Meenakshi followed up with a deluge of songs before and during a fun filled Antakshari session. Sai, Padmini and Sarita sang some old numbers, some of which seemed like \u0026ldquo;home-productions\u0026rdquo; to the opposite team.\n\nMartoli We woke up to some rain and cloudy weather. We delayed the start a little bit, to make the trek more comfortable, since it was going to be a short trek anyway. The skies cleared up pretty quickly and we hiked up to Martoli through a maze of Rhododendron trees!\nBhrujgali was supposed to be our next camp-site but we camped a little lower, at Martoli, because it had a more accessible water source. We did the same at Rohini Bugyal, the previous day, camping at Tala instead of the usual spot.\nThe hike was a pretty simple one, that took about 4 hours. We stopped at a refreshing stream on the way, where we had our lunch and took lots of photos! The trail was a forest trail that seemed very similar to some of the trails through the Sahyadris. One of the trekkers, Padmini, took a different trail at a fork and we had a few anxious moments, looking around, for her. She had some very anxious moments, but was really happy that she was brought back safely to the group by Dhan Singh. It may be useful for the trekkers to carry a whistle to make it easier to seek attention in such cases, Sai mentioned. I spent some time during the rest of the hike walking with Padmini, chatting up and getting know things about each others\u0026rsquo; lives.\nI decided not to click any photographs and look around more. Also, not having much power in the battery helped enforce this decision. Batteries drain pretty quickly in such cold weather, and I learnt that keeping the batteries in your sleeping bag can help prevent that. I wonder why people don\u0026rsquo;t carry some kind of solar chargers, instead of carrying so many spare batteries and power banks. Also, it may be interesting to look for devices that convert some of the energy spent hiking into usable power.\nThe evening was spent relaxing, talking and getting to hear more stories! We also had the company of the group who had gone to the summit on that day, and were trying to help us with some tips from their newly gained experience! We were taught how to use clamp-ons, micro spikes and gaiters, in case there is snow or ice on the trail.\n\nIt was going to be a 4am start the next day, and almost everyone hit the sacks immediately after an early dinner. Rajesh and I, though, were struck by the beauty of the night sky. I tried my hand at some night sky photography and got some okay-ish shots, including one which captured a shooting star. A wide angle lens and a tripod would\u0026rsquo;ve been extremely useful.\n\nSummit day Activity started in the camp-site from as early as 2:30 am. Excitement was in the air. Trek leads and guides were pushing hard to get people lined up as early as possible, to avoid hiccups due to melting ice and snow in the trek. We managed to get the whole group going by 4:15 am. It was going to be one of our steepest climbs of the trek, to Bhrujgali, in the darkness. Owing to the darkness, the two guides and the trek lead had to be helping people out, more than usual. I ended up being the sweeper until it was dawn, with some company from Abhirut, Ankit and Shyamlee. It was fun just screaming out to push people, mentally. Much like cheering from the sidelines during a game of Ultimate.\nIt was inspiring to see people pushing themselves hard, despite their physical problems. Asthma, cramps, come what may, lets get to the top! I hiked up with Padmini, who was probably the eldest trekker and was slowly but steadily making her way up. It always helps to have someone talking to you, to distract you from your lizard brain. She was quite happy that I walked with her all the way up.\nThe bird watchers amongst us, were delighted by how many Monals they spotted. The view from the top was gorgeous. Many many dozens of photographs were taken, in various poses, and various directions. It all looked so glorious that nobody really wanted to stop. So many snow covered peaks, all around. Raju bhai, Dhanno bhai and Kamal bhai had a lot of work to do, telling all of us the names of the different peaks that we could see. But, not before the excitedly told the rest of the India Hikers that everyone in the group had summit-ed. They were very pleased by the fact that the whole group made it safely to the top!\n\nOn some of the previous nights, I saw some folks use apps on their phones to help them identify stars and constellations in the night sky. Nobody seemed to have an app that helped identify the peaks. It would be interesting to find or build something that does this.\nThe descent was much simpler and quite relaxed. 5 of the trekkers left early, because they wanted to get to Haridwar for some more adventure and fun \u0026ndash; rafting and more bird/animal watching.\nThe weather suddenly turned bad. It got super cloudy and the wind got really chilly, before there was hail and snow. Everyone got into their tents for the afternoon, and this was practically the first afternoon I spent inside the tent. Once we got out of the tents after a couple of hours, the landscape had totally changed. Everything above about 50m from where we were was filled with snow, and we experienced the coldest and harshest weather of the trek. It was the first time, I felt I had got the balance of how much cold clothing I should be carrying wrong. I had used up all the layers of clothing I had, and yet felt a chill when I was not inside a tent. Next time around I\u0026rsquo;ll definitely erring on the side of carrying more. The weather didn\u0026rsquo;t get any better until the next morning.\nWe spent the evening in the dining tent, chatting away and playing Uno \u0026ndash; led by Mitali, a 10 year old who also breezed through the trek along with Dhruv who was also 10. We stuck together the whole evening to keep ourselves warm, and the trek was officially called to an end with certificate distribution and everyone sharing some of their thoughts about the trek.\n\nThe end I got back to Delhi with the others, from Haridwar and then to Bangalore. Its nice to be back amongst friends and family and back in familiar places. But, the silence of the mountains does haunt you for a while.\nIf I do go back up the mountains through a trekking group, you know who I\u0026rsquo;m going to be going with! India Hikes did manage to give me that feeling of being a part of wonderful community that is trying to make High Altitude trekking more accessible by documenting various treks and arranging treks with excellent support including some very delicious food.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always liked the idea of \u0026ldquo;leaving a place better than you found it\u0026rdquo;. India Hikes seems to really believe in this idea, and is trying really hard to encourage trekkers to imbibe this value and help each other in this mission. I really hope that there\u0026rsquo;s at least a handful of people in each trek, who take back this idea along with pleasant memories from the mountains.\n\nOn the whole the trek was an amazing experience. Gach yaara! I am definitely looking forward to go on more treks. As much as I dislike harshly cold weather, the beauty of the mountains is just too irresistible.\nYou can view more pictures of the trek here.\n",

The discussion was quite interesting and the book received more than a couple of strong recommendations. So, I decided to pick it up.\nVery simply, the book is codified common sense explaining what Love is. Gary Chapman, the author, started with the question \u0026ldquo;What makes you feel loved\u0026rdquo; and found that the answers could be grouped into the following 5 categories:\n Words of affirmation Quality time Receiving gifts Acts of service Physical touch,  which he calls the languages of love. He also proposes that people have a primary language of love, and a failure to speak to a person in their primary language would make them feel unloved.\nThe book is filled with anecdotes to explain what each of these languages means and how to speak them, along with practical advice and exercises to learn to speak each of these languages. Though the book has been written with couples in mind, the fundamental ideas in this book can be applied to any relationships. I feel like it has been helping me connect a few dots, ever since I\u0026rsquo;ve started reading it.\nIt has been totally worth my time to read this book. A highly recommended read!\nBelow are some of my notes. Feel free to suggest improvements (for readability and otherwise) on the notes.\n \n",

     "title": "Partial postgres db dumps for a Django app",
     "content": " Off late, I have been working with a large postgres database that is used by an app built in Django. I wanted a partial dump of the database to try out some experimental clean up scripts. I haven\u0026rsquo;t really used databases before, and the last time I had to do this I did it in a pretty ad-hoc fashion. This time around, I tried to do it more methodically and to document it.\nThe Django Route I looked around for tools that let you do this, and found django-fixture-magic. I first tried it out on my older partial dump (10% as large as the original db) and it turned out to be reasonably fast and worked well, after making a few changes to get it working with Python 3.x. Its kitchensink flag to the dump_object seemed like a promising option, but didn\u0026rsquo;t really seem to get all the required tables for ManyToManyFields. I worked around it, by getting a dump of all the models which were related using Django\u0026rsquo;s dumpdata.\nGet a dump with objects of interest The dump_object command lets you run commands to select the objects that you want to have in the dump, and that is quite a useful thing.\npython manage.py dump_object dataset.Product -k --query '{\u0026quot;subcategory_id__in\u0026quot;: [1886, ...]}' \u0026gt; products.json  Also, get a dump of related tables.\n# Dump of related fields python manage.py dumpdata dataset.Attribute \u0026gt; attributes.json  Create the new empty db Next, create a new database where this fixture can be loaded!\n# Create the db sudo su - postgres createdb mydb # Create a user, if required createuser -P  Grant access to the user In the psql prompt type the following to grant the user permissions for the database.\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydb TO myuser;  Fix settings.py and create tables for the models. Make changes to settings.py to use the newly created database, and then create the tables used by the app, and then load the data.\npython manage.py syncdb python manage.py loaddata products.json  Too slow! This method worked and was reasonably fast when I was trying to get 20k rows from a table with about 200k rows, with all the dependencies.\nBut, when I tried to get a dump of about 200k rows from a table with 2M rows, it was way too slow to be of any use. There could\u0026rsquo;ve been a couple of reasons for this, which I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the time to look into, and debug.\n The web-server where the Django app was running, and the db server with the postgres database were on different machines in separate datacenters, which could\u0026rsquo;ve been adding a significant amount of latency.\n Just the size of the database being much larger could be making it slower?\n  These are things I should be looking into and learning about, when I have more time at hand. For now, I needed a quicker way to get a dump. Even though the raw SQL route was more manual, it turned out to be much quicker.\nRaw SQL dump route Get a dump of the interesting tables First, I had to get a dump of all the tables with the data I was interested in, one-by-one.\nCOPY (SELECT * FROM \u0026quot;dataset_product\u0026quot; WHERE (\u0026quot;dataset_product\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;subcategory_id\u0026quot; IN (319557, 94589, 332, 406, 626, 1886) AND \u0026quot;dataset_product\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;gender_id\u0026quot; = 1)) TO '/tmp/products.tsv' COPY (SELECT * FROM \u0026quot;dataset_photo\u0026quot; WHERE \u0026quot;dataset_photo\u0026quot;.\u0026quot;product_id\u0026quot; IN (SELECT U0.\u0026quot;id\u0026quot; FROM \u0026quot;dataset_product\u0026quot; U0 WHERE (U0.\u0026quot;subcategory_id\u0026quot; IN (319557, 94589, 332, 406, 626, 1886) AND U0.\u0026quot;gender_id\u0026quot; = 1))) TO '/tmp/photos.tsv' -- Copy a bunch of other tables!  Load the data from the dumps -- syncdb COPY dataset_product FROM '/tmp/products.tsv' ENCODING 'UTF8'; COPY dataset_photo FROM '/tmp/photos.tsv' ENCODING 'UTF8'; -- Copy a bunch of other tables!  Make tables writable Some of the tables did not let me write anything to them, until I altered the sequence for these tables.\nAutomating It would be pretty nice if all of this was automated \u0026ndash; allow a user to enter exactly the same kind of a query that django-fixture-magic lets you run, and figure out the SQL copies that need to be done to get the requested dump. Its something that currently would qualify as yak-shaving, but may be a handy thing to have. Someone somewhere possibly already has something that does this.\n",

I was inspired by this post in particular to try and be more meticulous about how I stay in touch with people. Michael Fogleman blogged about his contact management work-flow using keepintouch. It seemed to do most of what I wanted, but I wanted this to be integrated with my org-contacts-db and I felt having native elisp code would make it easier to hook up email, chat, etc. to this.\nI ended up writing a small utility called howdy to help me keep in touch with people.

     "content": "To update some data plan changes, I had to restart my router today. I did so from the (web) admin interface, from my dad\u0026rsquo;s laptop. Guess what! The router goes invisible (to the laptop), after the restart! Other devices were still happily connected.\nThere were a few occasions in the past when this laptop had failed to find our home router. The solution that worked for my dad before was to restart the router; once, or may be a couple of times. But, this time it didn\u0026rsquo;t work.\nI had a feeling this was something to do with \u0026ldquo;Channels\u0026rdquo;, but I had no idea what was going on.\nI logged onto the router and started looking at the Wireless settings in the hope of finding some clue, and there it was! Wireless Channel: Auto Scan\n It was anybody\u0026rsquo;s guess that some channels that the router uses weren\u0026rsquo;t supported by my dad\u0026rsquo;s laptop. The restarts sometimes helped because the router would scan for channels that it thinks would work well, and end-up using something that the laptop\u0026rsquo;s wifi card supported.\nThe router only had options of channels from 1 to 13. To see what channels a wifi card supports, you can run the iwlist freq command.\niwlist freq  eth1 26 channels in total; available frequencies : Channel 01 : 2.412 GHz Channel 02 : 2.417 GHz Channel 03 : 2.422 GHz Channel 04 : 2.427 GHz Channel 05 : 2.432 GHz Channel 06 : 2.437 GHz Channel 07 : 2.442 GHz Channel 08 : 2.447 GHz Channel 09 : 2.452 GHz Channel 10 : 2.457 GHz Channel 11 : 2.462 GHz Channel 12 : 2.467 GHz Channel 13 : 2.472 GHz Channel 14 : 2.484 GHz Channel 36 : 5.18 GHz Channel 38 : 5.19 GHz Channel 40 : 5.2 GHz Channel 42 : 5.21 GHz Channel 44 : 5.22 GHz Channel 46 : 5.23 GHz Channel 48 : 5.24 GHz Channel 149 : 5.745 GHz Channel 153 : 5.765 GHz Channel 157 : 5.785 GHz Channel 161 : 5.805 GHz Channel 165 : 5.825 GHz  So, the laptop\u0026rsquo;s wifi card support all the channels that the router could use. iwlist freq also gives the current Channel if the device is already connected to a router. I ran this on my laptop and found that the router was using Channel 13. Why the hell wouldn\u0026rsquo;t this work?! I don\u0026rsquo;t know!\nI decided to set a channel manually, but how do I pick a channel? The idea of \u0026ldquo;Auto Scan\u0026rdquo; is to find a channel that has relatively low interference. How do we do this manually? sudo iwlist scan scans for all the WiFi access points nearby and gives detailed information about them, which includes the Channel.\nIt looked like most of the routers nearby used channels 1 and 6, with a few 3s and 4s. Assuming, most of the other routers aren\u0026rsquo;t doing this \u0026ldquo;Auto Scan\u0026rdquo; business, I set my router to always use Channel 9, and the laptop seems to be happily connected, now!\n",

     "content": "Those who read the last few posts here, would know that I have been experimenting with org-drill (a spaced repetition extension to Org mode). I have been using the system (almost) religiously for the past 2 months, and I do find that it has helped a great deal! (in some respects). I have also spent a considerable amount of time trying to reduce the friction to put new stuff into the system, and am constantly on the look out for further improvements.\nUsing this system has definitely helped with retention, and I find that I can recall quite a few things I have read a few weeks ago, that I would normally have been unable to. Though, I can recall a lot of information, I have been having a feeling of \u0026ldquo;fragmentation\u0026rdquo;: the feeling of just retaining individual bits/fragments of information, while losing out on actually internalizing the knowledge; not seeing the big picture, etc.\nWozniak (the author of super-memo) warns against learning without understanding, and memorizing before actually learning stuff. I haven\u0026rsquo;t consciously added stuff into the system that I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand (when I added it), but, later it does feel like I have lost some connections or the understanding, and am only holding onto the fragments of information.\nThe problems as explained in (read: as interpreted by me from) Make it Stick appear to be:\n The understanding (if any) at the time of adding stuff into the spaced-repetition system is untested. It may just be familiarity masquerading as understanding.\n The lack of any spaced repetitions for the overall concept/understanding and actual repetitions only for individual bits doesn\u0026rsquo;t help retention of the understanding (even if there was any, in the first place).\n  To work around this, I\u0026rsquo;m going to try adding questions that test understanding, to the system. The Super-memo team strongly recommends keeping the drill items small and easy to answer. This may be helpful in keeping each drill session short, but I would really like to add conceptual questions to the system, and see how it goes. I hacked org-drill to allow me to type out answers, before looking at the \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; ones. This is an adaptation of a system that a fellow Hacker Schooler uses, and shared. Also, hopefully forcing myself to type out the answer will help me get around the problem of sometimes saying \u0026ldquo;yeah I know that\u0026rdquo;, then looking at the answer only to reaffirm the feeling of familiarity, rather than actually testing myself. I\u0026rsquo;m still going to continue adding quick and short questions that test \u0026ldquo;bits of information\u0026rdquo;, though. But, hopefully the additional conceptual questions are going to tie things together and help fill in the gaps. Lets see how this goes!\nFor those interested, my hacks to org-drill below.

     "title": "How I learnt to use Emacs' profiler",
     "content": "I learnt to use Emacs\u0026rsquo; profiler yesterday, after many hours of yak-shaving, trying to get Memacs working. Memacs is a memory extension system for Emacs written by Karl Voit, that I have been meaning to try out for a long time now. Seeing lots of review posts at the turn of the year and watching Karl\u0026rsquo;s recent Emacs Chat with Sacha Chua pushed me to try and finally set it up.\nI started writing a module to create a Memacs file \u0026ndash; an org archive file \u0026ndash; from my browser history. It was pretty easy to write, and I had it spitting out a huge file with 22k entries after about a couple of hours of work. Then I excitedly pulled up my agenda, and turned on the option to view archived entries, only to be super-disappointed. It turned out to be extremely slow! Actually, the agenda never came up with the 22k entries file that I had. At least not in 5 or so minutes, before I got impatient. The performance was unacceptable even when I reduced it to 5k entries.\nI was pretty sure it wasn\u0026rsquo;t that slow for Karl in his demo and tweeted to him, asking for a workaround. Meanwhile, I looked at his dot-emacs, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to dig out what was needed to speed up things. He confirmed that his performance was way better than what I was getting.\nFirst, I ruled out the possibility of it being because of the SSD, since clearly my CPU usage was peaking, and the task was CPU bound and not I/O. Next, I tried using the same file on a different machine (with a different version of Emacs and org-mode), and it worked blazingly fast. So, it was either the version of Emacs or org-mode that I was using.\nI should have stopped, thought clearly, and started experimenting with org version, but hindsight is 20-20. I tried Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s pre-built Emacs and agendas were fast! I suspected my Emacs build, since I recently started building Emacs from git. I built two or three other versions of Emacs, and wasted a lot of time, before realizing that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t using the org-mode source bundled inside Emacs for the tests, and there were two \u0026ldquo;independent\u0026rdquo; variables.\nFinally, I began bisecting org-mode\u0026rsquo;s source and found that all hell broke loose with an inconspicuous change around release 8.2.6. It turns out that org-overview was broken before this, and collapsing all the trees in a newly opened org-buffer (default option) wasn\u0026rsquo;t working. Once this bug was fixed, opening huge org files would slow down by a great deal, in turn causing agenda generation to be unbearably slow.\nAll I had to do was add a #+STARTUP: showeverything to the top of the file. This speeded up things by about 50 times! It turns out, I later found out, that all of this is documented on Worg. I did try a few search engine queries, but sadly none of them brought this up. Adding the following to my config, speeded up agenda generation by about 150-200 times!\n(setq org-agenda-inhibit-startup t) ;; ~50x speedup (setq org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance nil) ;; 3-4x speedup  In the course of all this debugging, I learnt how to use Emacs\u0026rsquo; profiler. The profile reports along with git bisect, eventually helped me figure out what the problem was.\nTo profile the CPU usage, all you have to do is add a call like\n(profiler-start 'cpu) ;; or M-x profiler-start  at the place where you wish to start it. Emacs will then start collecting information about where time is being spent, by sampling every sampling-interval seconds (default 106 nanoseconds = 1 milli second).\nYou can view the information being collected, at any point of time using\n(profiler-report) ;; or M-x profiler-report  The report is a nice, interactive tree with the percentage of time spent in each call. You can stop profiling by calling (profiler-stop). If you have more than one report, you can compare them by hitting = in one of the report buffers. I\u0026rsquo;m definitely going to use this for other things! (like speeding up my startup?)\nNow that I have Memacs working with reasonably fast agenda views, I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to collecting as much personal information as I can! Thanks Karl for writing Memacs. I am going to be a pretty heavy user, I think! There seem to be a few rough edges, though, and I hope to help smoothen them out a little bit, over the next few weeks.\n",

Instead of persisting sexps, though, I persist the messages in a JSON format and the queue is flushed every time I connect to jabber, in a jabber-post-connect-hook.\nTo make the interface as similar to the interface available when I am online, I hacked completion for the to ID using email addresses in my address book (mu4e~contact-list).

I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet really tried out incremental reading, but in an attempt to make it as easy as possible, I wanted to have a pdf-reader integration, and some kind of integration with Kindle highlights.

Good old xpdf seemed to be the only pdf reader that had some support for custom keybindings that allowed users to run external commands.

I really enjoyed the discussion on Refactoring (the noun, the verb and the book!)\nMartin clarified in the podcast that refactoring (the verb/process) is a sequence of very small refactorings, while you keep making sure that you can run the test suite always. A refactoring (noun) is a change where you change the structure of the code without any externally observable changes, with the intent of making it easier to understand and cheaper to change in future.\nI also really liked the metaphor of a \u0026lsquo;healthy code base\u0026rsquo;. Refactoring is, then, the process of keeping healthy \u0026ndash; exercise, speaking metaphorically. You can stack up all the exercise you need to do, until you get really unfit. Refactoring, similarly, needs to be done regularly, to keep the code base healthy. This lets you go faster, in the future.\nI also really liked the advise about trying to push back the mental contexts you build, while trying to debug/understand some code that is not very clear, by refactoring the code to make it clearer. Code needn\u0026rsquo;t be one big chunk of cryptographic text. Code is writing. It should be clear and understandable. Or, at least we should strive to make it so!\nThe discussion, as always on this podcast, was very lively, pleasant and enjoyable! Enjoy!\n",

     "content": "I have been reading a bunch of articles on the SuperMemo site (including the original thesis of P. A. Wozniack, the creator of SuperMemo). I initially started off trying to understand the algorithms SM2,5 and 8 which org-drill implements, but reading the articles has given me a lot of general background and theory on how memory works, and why SuperMemo is as effective as it is (for those who stick with it). This blog post is an attempt to summarize and capture what I have read in all those articles, and not get lost in them. I would recommend reading the thesis and the suggested reading there, yourself, but if you really don\u0026rsquo;t want to \u0026ndash; this blog post + the summary in here, and here would be a good alternative.\n Memory works by repetition. Each time you recall a fact, the time it takes for the memory to fade increases. Spaced repetition is the idea of repeating items, just when you are about to forget them \u0026ndash; trying to optimize the time spent on learning, as well as the retention of learned material.\n Prioritization of the items we need to learn is key to being able to stick to Spaced repetition. Beginners tend to be over-enthusiastic about the technique and fill up their system with stuff that they don\u0026rsquo;t really care about. Applicability of the knowledge you are trying to gain, is a good test for whether or not it goes into your system.\n Each version of SuperMemo comes with a slightly modified (on most occassions, improved!) algorithm. SM2, SM5, \u0026hellip; refer to these algorithms. Org-drill currently supports only sm2,5 and 8. It may be worth looking at sm15/16 and seeing if it can be implemented and is worth doing. In any case, using any of these is way better than not using Spaced repetition at all.\n Understanding what we are trying to learn goes a long way in helping memory. It is, therefore, good to start with basic material. People have been surprised by how easily the advanced stuff fell into place, once they had the basics covered.\n Keep items in the system simple. Stick to the minimum information principle. Keeping it simple, doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you leave out on learning the complex stuff; instead break it into simpler components. Simpler items has the following advantages:\n Simple is easier to remember. Simpler items are easier to schedule. You get more resolution to figure out what the problem areas are. Simple makes brings in redundancy automatically. And redundancy is good for memory, just like it is for managing hardware failure.  Keep learning fun! Don\u0026rsquo;t make review sessions a chore. Think about the material you are reviewing. Edit/delete/improve items based on your reviews, then and there. Stay active.\n It is useful to add a link to the source of the items added to your system, considering that you wish to use the system over a long period of time (ideally, the rest of your life!)\n Prioritize, add examples, appeal to your emotional state, link to existing knowledge, use images. Anything else that works for you! Use all of these techniques, that work well and you probably already use in everyday life, in the items you add to your system, to make them easier to recall.\n Being physically fit and healthy is important for being so mentally. Exercise, sleep, eat well, avoid caffeine.\n Try incremental reading, as an input source of items into your memory system.\n  ",

Somehow, I hoped that it would be better this year, but no such thing happened.\n I should strictly not attend any talks, at the next conference I am at. Even if the topic seems interesting, I should refrain from attending any talks, unless I know that a speaker is entertaining.\n I should be going there to meet old friends, meet a few new people, and mostly hacking on my stuff. May be aim to show something at the lightning talks at the end of second day, based on what I did during the rest of the event.\n Participate more actively in open spaces, and may be initiate or suggest some myself. Sprints for bug fixing, adding new features to a project may be a good way to get new developers to start contributing to FOSS projects. It would be even better to be in touch with folks before the event, and use this opportunity to iron out kinks.\n  I think the talks could be improved drastically. A lot[1][2] has been said, already. Here\u0026rsquo;s a summary of how I see it.\n Beginner/Novice talks doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean bad talks. A talk with a good narrative, that drives home a point, that may be familiar to most of the audience, would still make a good talk. I don\u0026rsquo;t mind reading a good blog post/book on a topic I already know, because there is joy in reading/listening to \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; stuff.\n Talks cannot be judged by titles or an abstract. Taking inspiration from PyCon US, we could\n Ask for a video recording of a previous talk or a short home-made recording of the speaker presenting some topic.\n Ask for a granular outline [6] along with rough timing information, instead of just an abstract.\n Have a bunch of resources [3][4][5] available for speakers to improve on their proposals/accepted talks.\n Have a bunch of 20 or 30 minute talks, and very few longer (45 min) talk slots.\n Encourage speakers to try connecting their laptops and iron out \u0026ldquo;presentation\u0026rdquo; kinks on the day before their talks/lunch/other allotted times. Technical issues like fonts being too small, mics not working, adjusting the volume/other settings for the speaker, etc. can and should be fixed before hand.\n The talk review committee could also take notes from attending some of the talks, and compare it against their notes when they accepted the talk, to improve the talk selection process. Some of it could be valuable feedback for the speakers too.\n   [1] https://plus.google.com/+sankarshanmukhopadhyay/posts/8QY4o3hiyLT\n[2] https://mail.python.org/pipermail/inpycon/2014-October/009189.html\n[3] https://us.pycon.org/2015/speaking/proposal-resources/\n[4] http://doughellmann.com/2011/10/18/how-i-review-a-pycon-talk-proposal.html\n[5] http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2012/06/19/pro-tips-for-conference-talks/\n[6] https://us.pycon.org/2015/speaking/proposal_advice/samples/SpacePug/\n",

Just (require 'org-drill), and you are all set! To add a new card, all you need to do is add a :drill: tag to the items you wish to \u0026ldquo;Org-drill\u0026rdquo;. You can start a review session with simply M-x org-drill. You will be shown flash cards, and you can rate how correct and comfortable you were, in answering the questions. Based on your responses, the cards are scheduled for review. Start another review session, whenever you need one!\nWhat I could only understand once I got myself to read the whole document was that:\n The default scope of a drill session is the current file. But, you can start sessions with scopes like current tree, current directory, or a specified list of files. This is super-useful!\n The review sessions are not automatically scheduled, based on when you schedule failed flash-cards. Scheduling the review for a card only sets a due-date for them, and effects, what you are asked in your next session.\n  Cram mode and incremental reading are also things I want to try, as I go along.\nHappy Learning!\n",

The problem happens because the image URLs are returned from the HS API calls, that are made whenever a user logs in(?), and the URLs are cached. Since, HS uses cloudfront for its assets, the URLs expire after a period of time, and the cached urls in blag\u0026rsquo;s database need to be updated.

I also tried to look for \u0026ldquo;easy\u0026rdquo; python issues that would involve me writing some C code, but didn\u0026rsquo;t really find anything other than documentation\u0026hellip; I guess, I should pick a module and look for bugs in it, instead. Also, while chatting with a friend, I had to explain that I don\u0026rsquo;t mention the last names of people or link to them, for privacy reasons. Hacker School is particularly careful about not divulging information about who are at Hacker School each batch, and I want to keep that tradition.  ",

We had talked about having the music stream via airplay, but Nick got his DJing tools, and it would be too bad to not use it for the party, but doing that meant Airplay\u0026rsquo;s delay wouldn\u0026rsquo;t help the DJ. So, we connected a line-in, and thought we\u0026rsquo;d be done if we just read the input and used that data. But, it turns out that\u0026rsquo;s not so simple because sending data over the wire, added noise to it, and in a whole range of frequencies! I tried removing all the fourier coefficients which were lower than a threshold, but I felt like it didn\u0026rsquo;t work very well, until Nick reduced the gain of this output on the amp to the very minimum. Finally, Kyle and I decided that this was good enough for the party!\n I also hacked up a quick script to read a font file, and use the grey values to get ascii characters to show up on the LED strip.\n  Miscellaneous  While trying to find the RPi on the network, I learnt that sudo nmap -sP 10.0.1.* gives us the hostname as well, instead of just IPs. sudo being the key, here.\n Kyle and I went and grabbed dinner in a restaurant in west village.

Logically, it makes sense that Mel came now, so that she didn\u0026rsquo;t have to come twice to talk to the firsts and seconds, but it would have been great to have had this talk in the first week of Hacker School! Mel gave us a lot of new information and insights into education and learning styles. I also like the fact that she gave us all a good vocabulary to think about and discuss stuff related to learning. I will try to think, and apply as much of this as I can, for the rest of my time here. She talked about test driven learning which seemed very interesting. Instead of just saying, \u0026ldquo;wow that would be an interesting thing to do\u0026rdquo;, stop for a moment, think about what you are trying to learn, and how you will assess if you have learnt what you wanted to, and then dive into the project. The learning styles workshop was pretty good too, though I feel like I don\u0026rsquo;t know myself well enough, and I unable to properly \u0026ldquo;bucket\u0026rdquo; myself.

Mel introduced us to the idea of cognitive apprenticeship, and encouraged us to try out the different modes when pairing.

Motivation and mindset, \u0026hellip; Be courageous!  Airplay and Raspberry Pi  I was trying to wrap libshairport and use it on the RPi to be able to listen to songs being streamed on Airplay, and use that data to drive the LEDs. Shairport, a tool written in C seemed to work. My attempts to wrap libshairport, which is a fork of shairport converting it into a library, failed miserably. The trouble was essentially getting Airplay to discover my service. I tried a bunch of things with pybonjour and avahi, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to get it right. Finally, I tried just announcing the service with shairport, and actually running a python script that wraps libshairport to listen to the data. But, this didn\u0026rsquo;t work and iTunes complained that this Airplay device is not compatible. Before going much further with this, I found shairplay which is a tool similar to shairport, but came with a library, and also Python bindings! I happily used this to get stuff working! I\u0026rsquo;m interested to see today, what exactly I was missing yesterday!  Emacs club  I demoed org-mode to a bunch of people for about half an hour, and it was good to see people being blown away by what it can do, exactly the way I was, when I first came across it.  Today  Work on RPi to clean up a few things for the party. Compare libshairplay and libshairport to see what I was doing wrong, yesterday. May be write up the whole thing, and make the code available. Learn a little bit about Parsers from rntz.  ",

Also, cleaned up the install.sh used by lightshowpi project to not do all the ugly sudo setups, and use a Python virtualenv and install into that. Refactored the ugly looking music part of the tutorial into a smaller script with only the functionality that we were going to use. We hit an interesting bug that would light up all the LEDs on the strip, once in a while. I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice it during the night, because I had a \u0026ldquo;decay\u0026rdquo; factor (the max factor by which the height of the columns should get reduced between successive updates) was 0.9, but when the decay factor was reduced to a lower value, it would happen quite often. Also, we didn\u0026rsquo;t see this happening before. So, we thought the bug was in the code I had written, when I should have been sleeping. After reading and debugging my code for a bit, with Kyle and Sean, I thought it was something hardware related that we were doing wrong. But, it turns out that a library we were using lit-up the whole strip, when start and end values were both zero, instead of not lighting up anything!

Depending on each person\u0026rsquo;s personality, or the way their brain works, they are good at doing one or the other. Getting good at programming is a matter of showing up, more than about the \u0026ldquo;genes\u0026rdquo;.

So, I used something like _D['a'], D_['b'] = D_['b'], D_['a']. Essentially, changed D on the right hand side to D_. I thought I had tested this on the terminal, but after hours of debugging (along with fixing another minor issue), I later found out that the tuple unpacking doesn\u0026rsquo;t work and the swapped rows and columns actually become equal!

I also tried to read up about Monads, and worked through exercises from a few different places. I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet finished the exercises in Chapter 12 of the UPenn course. I just looked at them today, and they seem like a complete bouncer at first glance. I went on a really long walk with Naren, and food-hopped with him while he was telling me stories about the various places he worked at and the kinds of things he has been working on, and things he liked and disliked about them. It has been a good weekend to spend with Naren! Also, the long walk and talking to Chaitu cleared my head a bit, and I decided to pause the Haskell tutorials and learning for the next couple of weeks. I don\u0026rsquo;t really have a project that needs me to learn Haskell, right now. I should stick to project and need based learning, which I enjoy the most. Right now, I feel like working on an key stroke acoustic emanation based key-logger. Just before applying to Hacker School, I came across the idea of side-channel attacks, and it sounded pretty exciting. I don\u0026rsquo;t intend to snoop onto anybody, but the project seems to be challenging enough, and I will have quite a bit to learn about. It will involve signal processing, and learning \u0026ndash; both areas that I have seemed interesting to me for long, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t really done anything in them. I plan to work on the idea for a couple of weeks, and review my progress and chart my future course. The problem appears to have 2 parts to it.  Processing audio, and extracting key-strokes from it. Identifying the text, based on a sequence of key-strokes. Though, in reality each press of a key may not sound the same, for a start assuming we are able to accurately get a sequence of key-strokes, the problem would reduce to solving a simple substitution cipher. I plan to start with this, tomorrow.  Also, I plan to hang out a lot more with Hacker Schoolers, and let myself be distracted a lot more by random discussions and activities, than I have allowed myself to be, in the past few weeks. I should be writing as much code as I can, while I\u0026rsquo;m here.

     "title": "OAuth2 demystified",
     "content": " Motivation I was trying to pair on writing a simple app that uses Hacker School\u0026rsquo;s OAuth2 API, and hit a roadblock on the first step of requesting an authorization from the user. Once the user authorized my app, I would see an error that said, \u0026ldquo;The authorization server does not support this response type\u0026rdquo;. I was using a client library that I had used before, and the server was using a what seemed like a popular implementation for ruby on rails. Getting weird errors is not done!\nI have used OAuth2 based authentication before, but the thought of using it always makes me a little nervous, just because\n I don\u0026rsquo;t understand it very well. Like almost everything else, there seem to be so many libraries for doing this in Python, and I\u0026rsquo;m never sure which one to use, or which one I used the last time around. Not understanding the protocol also doesn\u0026rsquo;t let me debug anything that comes up.  To fix this, I set about to read and understand the OAuth2 protocol. This blog post is an attempt to record it for future reference, and possibly act as a reference for others.\nWhy OAuth OAuth is simply a way for an end-user to allow third parties to use protected data, without sharing the user\u0026rsquo;s credentials with the third-party.\nFor example, an end-user (Jane) can grant a printing service (Printo) access to her protected photos stored at a photo-sharing service (Picasa), without sharing her username and password with the printing service. Instead, she authenticates directly with a server trusted by the photo-sharing service, which issues the printing service delegation-specific credentials. (example from the OAuth 2.0 spec)\nProtocol Flow The flow occurs through a sequence of user actions, client requests and user-agent (browser) redirects.\n (A) Printo asks Jane to allow using Picasa Data. The request can be sent directly to Jane, but is usually routed via Picasa/Google.\n (B) Printo gets back an authorization grant, which is a credential representing Jane\u0026rsquo;s authorization or approval. The type of the actual grant credential depends on the type of request that Printo used.\n (C, D) Printo gets back to Google with the credentials it obtained in the previous step and obtains a token that it can use to talk with Picasa.\n (E, F) Printo asks for the desired photo with the token it obtained previously, and Picasa gives back the photo to print. Jane gets her framed photo!\n  But before any of this happens, the client needs to register with the authorization server and obtain a client_id and client_secret, that will be used to identify the client making the requests.\nPythonized \u0026ldquo;authorization code\u0026rdquo; work-flow. The OAuth2 spec allows the authorization request/grant to be of 4 different types. It also allows some flexibility in the token type.\nIn my experience, the most common work-flow seems to be using an authorization code as an authorization grant, and using a Bearer type token. This work-flow is explained in the diagram below (taken from the spec document). This diagram zooms in, onto the steps A-D in the diagram above.\nThis python code snippet is a simple implementation of this workflow, using the Hacker School API.\n Conclusion I think, I understand the OAuth2 spec a lot better now, and hope that this will help others understand it, too. And more importantly, I won\u0026rsquo;t get nervous when I have to add it to my projects.\nAlso, oauthlib for Python seems to be a pretty thorough implementation of the spec, and requests-oauthlib seems to wrap it for use with requests. I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to use this in my future projects.\n",

While they were working on getting it to work on OSX, I was trying to write a simple Python example to do it, and was getting a weird error about the response_type being not supported. I was using rauth in a way very similar to what I had done for statiki but the Hacker School API server wasn\u0026rsquo;t letting me through. I could debug it only a little before lunch, and a little bit after lunch. And realized that the response_type had to be one of code or token and not json or empty. But this is a required parameter, and I expected rauth to do the right thing!

Before the arrival of the Portuguese, most Goan houses were mostly made of mud and had a thatched roof. They faced inwards towards a central courtyard and had small windows, mostly devoid of ornaments.\nThe Portuguese arrived in Goa in 1510 and brought with them a host of cultural and aesthetic influences from Europe and other places. Goans who travelled abroad also returned with ideas and influences from other countries that they incorporated into their houses.\n Spocial Revolution: The Ultimate Frisbee - More than just a flying disc\nthe high that playing Ultimate Frisbee gives me, is pretty damn unbeatable.\n The Madness of the Planets - Issue 8: Home - Nautilus\n“If you want to describe a specific person in detail, I cannot do it in a general scheme.

The sun was just setting and everything outside his window was given a fresh coat of snow, tickled by the red, quickly fading light. Not that he noticed. He stared blankly out of the window, looking at nothing in particular. He had just woken up from his afternoon nap; but he\u0026rsquo;d buy it if you told him he\u0026rsquo;d been sleeping for a year\u0026hellip;\nYou could see the icy river crawling ahead, from his window. People walking over the bridge, a few camera flashes going off, people stopping over and looking far ahead into the horizon \u0026ndash; collecting their thoughts, couples walking hand-in-hand enjoying each others\u0026rsquo; company; You could see it all, from up there! But, as they say, you only see what you look for. And he, couldn\u0026rsquo;t see any of this. His looked out of his window and saw none of this.\nHe is walking down the same bridge. He didn\u0026rsquo;t know where he was going; his head at least. His legs did; as always. He was walking down in his regular yellow shirt and black jeans, that you could mistake for a uniform, if you followed him for a few days. Extremely under-dressed for the chilly night, one would say. He kept walking down the main street, lined with shops brightly lit up for the festive season. The pavement bustled with with people walking with a spring in their step \u0026ndash; the spring that the festive season and all the love in the air brought to you. Not that he noticed it, or had any of it in his step.\nSoon, he\u0026rsquo;s walking through the park. The park that was built to celebrate time, ticking away furiously. Or to celebrate the time everyone in the world had, to enjoy themselves. He walked past the skating rink, with lots of people having the time of their life, ice skating; and a lot more, awaiting their turn. The first timers, old and young, making up for their inexperience, with their excitement; holding onto whatever they can, to finish each round, to start the next! The veterans, taking the center-stage and showing off their moves! He was barely aware of their presence and just walked on, past all the action.\nThe music festival; he walked past it too, like the crowd didn\u0026rsquo;t exist, the noise didn\u0026rsquo;t, the music didn\u0026rsquo;t; like there was nothing happening! The fountain \u0026ldquo;felt\u0026rdquo; no different. The cold breeze, did sprinkle the water to quite a distance and everybody kept a safe distance to avoid the chilling shower, except for the kids, who found it amusing to run into the shower for a split second and run back madly. How could he walk just by it, and not feel a thing!\nThe lakefront. That is where his legs always brought him in the end. The brilliantly lit skyline was a delight to watch, but I don\u0026rsquo;t believe he saw any of it. He just stared into it, blankly. He kept staring, as the night got chillier and the surroundings kept getting more and more deserted. Seconds ticked away, minutes and hours passed by! He stayed on, staring ahead. It didn\u0026rsquo;t matter how much below zero the mercury had gone. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t the first night he was spending staring into the nothingness. It turned out to be the coldest night, in a decade. But that didn\u0026rsquo;t matter to him. Nothing did. Nothing has, for a while now; Ever since he turned cold.\n",

[Last year, I had the kids learn in a browser-based / console-like IDE that I created - kind of like CodeAcademy, but ultimately it was just too much work to maintain and too limiting]. My new plan is to teach the kids how to build their own interactive websites from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript, and to do it on their own Linux VPS (CentOS 6) using Vim.

It has become an increasingly difficult thing to define for the average person, and sometimes even art historians and experts can’t seem to keep up.\nThis was illustrated in a 2005 survey done by ABC News in which modern masters’ works were mixed into a series with paintings done by children and toddlers. Regular people and art critics alike were asked to choose from the series – which of these works belong in a museum and which ones don’t? Now, Buzzfeed has released a similar survey as well, which we’ve expanded on a bit.\nThe results of that survey indicate that either we have a long way to go before we can define what is and isn’t modern art, or that there’s no need to define it so strictly in the first place. Whatever the case may be, let’s see if you’re any better at telling modern art from children’s drawings than the experts are!\n  ",

     "content": "About 20 of us, gathered at Andheri Station, to leave for Surat. I was the only one playing in his/her first tournament, and it was exciting to be a part of a squad, going to a tournament. A first in my life. We had two teams, A and B, or better known as Storm and Chasers. I was playing for the Chasers team. The train journey was pretty uneventful for me, unfortunately so, because of a mixed up ticket booking and only 4 of us, sitting in the AC coach. I ended up reading or sleeping for most part of the journey. I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize, we could just walk into the other coach where most of the others were having a lot of fun!\nFountainhead School was the venue for the tournament, and they had arranged for transport, accommodation and food and drinks, all through the tournament. The organization for the tournament was pretty good, I must say! We had a bus pick us up at the railway station, and getting into the bus felt like we were some big team with our own team bus, and stuff (though, there was also the Silent Voice team on the bus ;). Ganesh and I had a little chat in the bus, and he was recollecting his experiences in his first tournament, and was asking me what I expected from the tournament, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t really have a good answer, because I was too excited. But, I really enjoyed the chat with him.\nWe all crashed at the school library for the night, for a hard day in the field on the next day. We rushed to the field, early next morning, about half a km of walk from the school, the playing field was in the middle of some fields and we warmed up to a lovely sun rise. Storm had their first game at 7, against Dream Catchers, and they started a little rusty in the first half, but came back strongly in the second one to beat them 11-7. This was going to be closest their opposition was going to come to winning! Chasers had their first game against Silent Voice, a team from Ahmedabad. We got together as a team for the first time, really, and having just one substitute player didn\u0026rsquo;t really help much. We got thrashed by Silent voice, 11-4 or 11-5. Chasers got the next game as a bye, since Lay Lapak failed to turn up for the tournament and this meant we slid up the table and got to play the Dream Catchers from Ahmedabad. Craig reached in time, from Mumbai, for this game, and we gave them a decent fight in this game, though the score line didn\u0026rsquo;t really suggest it. We were doing way too many mistakes (and repeating them!) near the end-zones and they were costing us a lot. The highlight of these games, though, was the spectacular layouts by Cheerag on D. Storm, meanwhile, thrashed the HAT team 11-0, and beat Surat Trailblazers convincingly.\nA lot of the teams had school kids on them, who were playing astonishingly well. The pick out of those was Jumbish, which had 10 to 15 year olds, jumping all over the place and giving their opposition a run for their money. The moment of the tournament for me was a catch by a Jumbish player, who jumped ahead of him, to take a catch, flipped over in the air without placing his hands on to the ground, and landed on his feet and made a perfectly nice pass to his team-mate! Exciting stuff to watch! Pune also has a nice Ultimate program for kids, and their team Royal Spirits was playing some good Ultimate.\nThe last game of the day was Storm vs. Flying Spirits from Pune, who were second on the points table, after Storm. But Storm was clinical in their execution, and \u0026ldquo;Bagel-ed\u0026rdquo; [read as, thrashed 11-0] Flying Spirits.\nAt the end of the day, we had a good dinner and lots of ice-cream and discussed our favorite moments of the day. I felt proud to have featured in atleast one person\u0026rsquo;s favorite moments, in my first tournament! W00t! Some of us fooled around on the dance floor for a while, to some Gujarati and Bollywood music.\nThe next day started with us playing Royal Spirits (Pune). We started off strongly, but ended up giving away some easy scores towards the end of the game, and ended up drawing the game at 6 all. Our next game against Storm was another Bagel for Storm. They played zone on us, and though we were as patient as we could be, we simply didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough skill and team work to score against them. Our next game against Flying Spirits was a very good game, and I\u0026rsquo;d rate it the best amongst our games. We played a good stack and played hard on D, and were able to keep the scores at 5-5 until the last 5 minutes, when they scored and finished winners. The Flying Spirits admitted to us giving them a good competition and making them work hard for their goals. Our last game was against Zero Gravity, a team from the school itself, and our first victory! We started off pretty strongly, and were able to finish the game 10-5.\nThe final between Storm and Cats-Dogs (Delhi) was so much fun to watch. Storm stuck to their clinical performance and everyone seemed to be playing at their best! They came out winners 13-4 in a game that lasted close to an hour and a half. All the other games, btw, were games-to-11 and time capped to 55 minutes. Storm also managed to win the Spirit award for the tournament, and it is the first time in Indian Ultimate\u0026rsquo;s history that a team won both the tournament and the spirit award!\nThe tournament was a lot of fun and a lot of learning for me. I learnt a lot of things from everyone playing there, specially from the players in Storm. I know I\u0026rsquo;ll carry forward some wonderful memories from my first tournament, thanks to everyone from Storm Chasers and everybody else, who I played against. I really liked the idea of spirit circles after the games, where each team discussed the game and appreciated the other team about particular aspects of their team and play and suggested areas that they could work on, to improve themselves. I also hung out around some of the spirit circles of Storm and their opposition and I really loved listening to Apu speak to the opposition. On almost every occasion, it gave me goosebumps! Thanks Apu, for showing us, what the spirit of the game should mean to each of us. Ganesh mentioned, in the chat we had on the bus to the school, that I\u0026rsquo;d learn a lot more than just Ultimate, and it turned out to be true. I got to learn a lot about my team, and everybody on Storm chasers. I experienced what it feels like, to be a part of a squad or a team, for the first time and it feels great, in short! Thanks Ganesh for the chat, and all the inspiration on-and-off the field. In the middle of one of the games, Willis walked up to me and told me to be more confident on the field and move more crisply on the field. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, that will change in one game, but that is something I\u0026rsquo;ll remember for a long time to come. Kayleigh reminded me of one of the good catches I took on day-1, by having it in her favorite moments of the day. As someone playing in his first tournament, that\u0026rsquo;s a pretty big deal! Thanks to Willis and Kayleigh for all the encouragement, guidance and training! Thanks to Parag for drilling it into our team, that we are going to keep the game\u0026rsquo;s tempo high, but our tempers low. The tournament was much more fun, that way. Thanks to Robo for giving me the cleats, and the encouragement during many a practice session. Thanks to Rose for being the wonderful captain that she was, thanks to Cheerag for showing us how much one can give on D, thanks to Craig, Diti, Rakesh, Sheryll and Vishal for being supportive and being patient with me and all my blunders. Thanks to Pixie for all the morning practice sessions, while we were waiting for everyone else to turn up. Thanks to Mak for help from the shouting helping me out from the side lines. Thanks to Jimmy, Megna, and Sarah, for making me feel a part of the squad, and for being a part of the wonderful Storm! Here are some pictures, thanks to Shantanu and Saurabh, who traveled all the way to Surat to watch, cheer and capture!\nEven if, our team won just one out of the 6 games we played, it was an Ultimate tourney. Literally! Looking forward to future tournaments.\n",

     "title": "Selling Temples -- A How-to",
     "content": "Disclaimer: All characters appearing in this work are divine. Any resemblance to real or divine persons, living or dead, is purely intentional.\nA few days back, a couple of friends and I were discussing, how anything sells in India and how opening a restaurant is seemingly an easy way to make some quick bucks. But, now, I have a much better plan to make some big money, may be not so quickly, but definitely a lot more \u0026ndash; at least by an order of magnitude.\nReligion! Nothing sells like it, in the land of snake charmers! People will buy anything on offer. This post gives the recipe for turning a small temple in a god forsaken town, into a big place of worship that \u0026ldquo;attracts\u0026rdquo; devotees from all over the country, if not the world!\nThe first task would be to zero-in on a temple. But before that, let\u0026rsquo;s define the kind of town we are interested in. Ideally, the town should be within a couple of hundred kilometers away from a city with good transport connectivity and a population at around one and a half million (There are about 20 such cities, in the country). The temple in question could piggy back on the fame of a temple nearby, if it is within about 50 kilometers of a really famous temple, but in that case, our temple would remain the second preference, for a very long time to come. But this is much easier to accomplish and arguably a quicker buck. Ideally, though, we\u0026rsquo;d prefer a location, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any other famous temples in the radius of about 300 kms (roughly 5-6 hours by road). It also helps if the travel to the temple for the big city is through the country side, giving a glimpse of the country side that urban Indians can only dream of connecting, the life that was once lived by their parents and grandparents, but they now only get to see in the movies. This will help us score some points with the \u0026ldquo;educated and sophisticated\u0026rdquo; urban populace.\nNow, the temple. It should be the biggest or the only one in town, though having smaller temples around helps in knitting more tales around the temple. The temple in question should be one, that the locals have tremendous faith in. You should be able to find at least a dozen people who vouch for the miraculous power of the gods in there, without trying too hard. That should be good enough, to get you going, and I believe this isn\u0026rsquo;t too hard for any random temple, anywhere in the country.\nThe gods. It really doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter who the god is. He/she could either be a generalist or a specialist and that would influence the type of crowds coming in. Your god can be as specialized as you like, up to the extent of specializing in blessing people get visas to the US. Now, your god can either be an already well known god, or a not so well known incarnation of a well known god, or a new person who is soon to become god! The first type is a hard bet; the third option is somewhat high risk too, and you\u0026rsquo;ll really need to put your mind to it, to make it work. The second option is the easiest one. It always helps to have some real objects and places that can be associated with the god, and are living proof that the god once lived here and used those things. It really helps if you can give the devotees the feeling that they are doing all the things that the god in question once used to do, at the same places he/she used to do it. Type-3 gods would work well for this.\nSpread the word. This, obviously, is the most important part and the hardest one too. It\u0026rsquo;s best to start with the word of mouth. Start with family and friends and friends of friends and friends of friends of friends (read as facebook-only-friends). Pick the more religious of the lot, encourage them to visit the place, write and share blog posts/tweets/pictures/tales/stories and whatever else, with them. Encourage them to interact with the locals. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it would be necessary to make any deals with the locals. They are smart enough, wherever you go! You need to actively market your god, until a critical mass of happy devotees, has been reached. A critical mass is reached, when there are more people talking of their wishes coming true, than there are people who are still waiting for their wishes to come true. This should be too hard given that, religious people tend to believe that whatever happens, happens for the best and god has better plans for them, than their own. Slowly, you could coax one of the better writers (who is also religious?) into writing a book or two about your temple. A couple of years after selling your book, you should try and encourage one of the big TV houses to make a teleserial based on the book, and that would be it! Now, you can sit back and relax.\nWhile getting all of the above right is important, it is also super important to work out things with the current priest, form a temple trust, and manage other such things and to time all of it perfectly. This part of the plan is left as an exercise for the reader.\nOn the whole, this is a much more fruitful exercise than setting up a restaurant, since this helps a whole economy grow around the temple. A whole bunch of things crop up, near our small town. Transportation grows by leaps and bounds, hospitals and schools grow with the population, the local vendors start earning more and get a better quality of life, and all that jazz. I guess, you get the drift.\n",

I spend quite a lot of time on GitHub, browsing the work of various people, looking at loads of interesting stuff that people built. I keep jumping between people pages and projects using the Watchers/Watching \u0026amp; Followers/Following pages. This way, I do come across interesting people and projects, but the SNR is too low. I wanted a better way to be able to see stuff, that I find interesting. That\u0026rsquo;s how the idea for this Chromium app \u0026ndash; GitHub Cue \u0026ndash; was born.\n@baali and I hacked on this, during the last few days and got it working. It works as follows, (from the README) \u0026mdash;\n Scrapes all the descriptions of the repositories being watched by the user. Key terms are extracted from this description text using the Yahoo Term Extractor. A list of languages is obtained, based on the languages of the repositories, the user if watching. GitHub searches are performed for a combination of 3 randomly chosen languages and 5 random key terms. 10 random repositories out of all these, are shown.  This is a very simplistic algorithm, but works decently for my purposes. Ideally, I would\u0026rsquo;ve liked to use a Collaborative Filtering algorithm, but I found the data to be too sparse, and the amount of computation to be too much to be done on the fly. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really interested in pre-computing stuff and putting it onto my server. I settled down to the next best thing I could think of.\nI would appreciate any further ideas and suggestions. Thanks!\n",

     "content": "Well, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if it\u0026rsquo;s worth writing about. I conducted my first org-mode workshop along with Prof. Venkatesh Choppella at IIIT-Hyderabad. It was a 3 hour demo+talk kind of a thing, with a small audience of about 20 people, most of whom were new to Emacs.\nWe covered almost all the aspects of Org-mode after giving a brief introduction to Emacs. Outlining and note-taking part was simple and easy to understand, but the audience couldn\u0026rsquo;t really appreciate the part of keeping TODO lists and agendas and other stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping, the reason was not me taking over from Venkatesh.\nI think the workshop should\u0026rsquo;ve been more hands-on and we should\u0026rsquo;ve asked people to try out stuff on the spot, instead of showing off the things possible with Emacs. They probably would\u0026rsquo;ve appreciated a few things better, that way.\nHopefully, we will be doing more workshops on Org-mode and there are surely somethings to take away from this one. I hope at least one of the participants, gets hooked to Org-mode.\nThe talk outline is here.\n",

     "title": "I love FOSS.  How do I start contributing (code)?",
     "content": " Why this article? I teach (Science and Engineering) students and teachers to use Python for their computational tasks. I\u0026rsquo;m occasionally asked this question or something similar. I remember, it was not too long ago, that I asked this question very often. I asked anybody who was more experienced than me, \u0026ldquo;How do I start contributing (code) to FOSS?\u0026rdquo; and all the answers I got, were very similar. Also, my answer is not going to be radically different. But, I would still like to answer this question, because -\n All the answers I got, were from big-time, experienced contributors. I suspect, they only vaguely remember how it feels to be just starting off. But, I am just starting off and I think my answer brings a slightly different perspective that would help others1. This piece of writing is meant to be one comprehensive compilation of things I want to share, if and when I\u0026rsquo;m asked this question in the future2. More than anything else, a reminder and reference for myself. I still have a long way to go. I only have a handful of contributions against my name (none of them earth shattering). I haven\u0026rsquo;t (yet) done my 10,000 hours of programming nor have I learned anything like half a dozen programming languages.3  Thanks to baali, Ringo and Voodoo for reading drafts of this article and giving some very valuable feedback to improve it.\nWhat should I do? I know how exciting the FOSS world seems, the first time we discover it. You are dying to contribute. You want to contribute, Right Now! But you\u0026rsquo;ve no clue, what, where and how. Relax. Give yourself time. You\u0026rsquo;ve a lifetime ahead of you. Explore. Explore, even more. Play with things, Try out stuff, Break stuff, Spill things all over the place. Have fun!4\nGiven that you are reading this, I presume that, you do have access to the Internet. But, if you don\u0026rsquo;t, it could turn an impediment to your goal. Easy access to a decent internet connection is a prerequisite.\nLearn a programming language, well3. By learning, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean getting familiar with the syntax or passing a bunch of exams. Get familiar with the paradigms of the language. Learn to think in that language. Write code that does something real, instead of doing toy examples.5 Also, it helps know bits and pieces about the history and evolution of the language. This will give you a sense of why some features are present (or absent) and will help you program better, in that language6.\nSome projects will definitely catch your eye, while you are exploring. Start using the ones that you need. Follow them!\nStart with using the bleeding edge 7 software. Bleeding edge refers to the latest sources of the project, where the active development is going on. Given the continuous nature of software development, using the latest source,\n prevents you from wasting time on fixing bugs that have already been fixed and lets you look at the latest changes being made and contribute effectively and easily  Also, start following the project\u0026rsquo;s mailing lists \u0026ndash; both the dev and the user lists, if they are separate. The user-list discussions will help you discover functionality and possibly give you some chance to peek at the source code, too. Don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised or worried if you don\u0026rsquo;t follow most of what goes on, in the dev-list. Be patient and keep at it. You will learn a lot about the what, why and how of the project. Also don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to look foolish there! There wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be one developer who doesn\u0026rsquo;t have some embarrassing logs of stuff she said in public, in her initial days.\nSlowly you\u0026rsquo;ll start to learn the dynamics of the community \u0026ndash; how things function, the DOs and DON\u0026rsquo;Ts, etc 8. Also, there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance that the project has an active IRC channel. If it does, hanging out there will give you more insights. Contributing to the documentation, is often a useful step before contributing code. Cleaning up the documentation or writing documentation, often requires you to read the code and helps you understand it better.\nNext, start acting on Bug reports (or tiny feature requests). Start with trying to reproduce the bugs and sending confirmations. Gradually, start looking at the source and trying to figure out where the problem is. Be patient, with this 9 . Once you get comfortable with the code and the coding style, start sending code snippets and comments, explaining what you think might be the problem. One fine day, you will be able to send a full working patch! But, before that don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to send partial fixes. You can learn a lot from the comments of the devs and looking at how they finally fixed it. Also, IRC could be a good place to ask for help, if you are stuck and are looking for some quick help, so you can move further.\nIn all of this, it helps if you have one (or a bunch of) favorite area(s) or module(s) of the project, specially in a big project. You should pounce upon any issues in your favorite area.\nParticipate in sprints. It\u0026rsquo;s not uncommon for projects to have regular sprints. Make it there 10! Also, a couple of developers may decide to meet up on a weekend and hack. If it\u0026rsquo;s happening in your neighborhood, ask if you can join. Don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised, if they shout out a big YES! You will definitely learn a lot, when there is help so close-by.\nA shortcut would be to start your own project! It is easier (in some ways) to release your own code under a FOSS license, than contribute to some of the existing projects. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to have your code approved by the project leads, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to mould your code to fit the standards of the project, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to read and understand all the (relevant parts of the) existing code, etc. But all of this, definitely teaches you a lot.\nAs a beginner, I think it is important to solve your own problems, problems that you care about (at least at that point in time). Most of the projects, started off with their developers wanting to solve their own problems. Only, incidentally, they solved some of the World\u0026rsquo;s problems, too!\nStart small, though. Don\u0026rsquo;t start off with a project that aims to replace Chrome or Firefox as the best browser, or an editor to replace Vim or Emacs. Writing extensions to your favorite software could be a good place to start, for instance an Emacs minor/major mode11, a Chrome extension12, etc. Stand on the shoulders of giants!\nAlso, take this as an opportunity to gain some of the skills that would be useful, when you want to start contributing to others projects.\n Learn to use Version Control (Git + GitHub is awesome!) Learn to use build and setup tools. Learn about packaging and distributing your software. Learn how to license your code. Learn to Collaborate!  All of this, I hope, would suffice to get your first contribution in. But, there are a few things that will help you in the long run.\nGood English. Specially written communication, since that is how you would be communicating, more often than not. Fair or not, hackers are known to be very particular about good communication. I\u0026rsquo;m not exaggerating when I say, what you say may be ignored even if it makes perfect sense, if you said it in sloppy English.\nUsing a *nix would put you in some great company. At the very least, you save time when looking for solutions to known problems. Using a good editor and learning to type quickly can be big productivity gains. You only get 24 hours a day!\nAn understanding of licensing issues, can come in handy, many a times.\nFor more, read How to Become a Hacker by Eric Raymond.\nHappy Hacking!\n I\u0026rsquo;m writing in the Indian context. ↩ All of this is generic advice, but students applying to programs like GSoC, may find it useful. ↩ Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years by Peter Norvig. ↩ Getting yourself a GitHub account and socializing there is a lot of fun and helps quite a bit. GitHub is my Facebook! ↩ I started learning Python from the Python tutorial and some other sources and doing the examples in them. It was good, but I think I started learning more, and better, when I started solving problems from Project Euler. And writing an IRC bot in Python, taught me a lot more than all of this. ↩ I recommend Python, but I am definitely biased. Any language that is generic enough would do, really. 1. It gets you off the blocks, very quickly. 2. It is easy to learn. 3. It is batteries included. Read as, comes bundled with a huge bunch of libraries. 4. It is general purpose enough. Read as, it has libraries that let you do anything, you\u0026rsquo;d possibly want to do. 5. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of Python code around, that you can read andlearn from. ↩ You may have to learn to use a version control system; at the very least cloning and pulling updates. ↩ Org-mode is the only project that I really contribute to, actively. I really liked the way the community gels together and the kind of people on the list. There are some really knowledgeable, friendly and helpful people. It feels great to be a part of the community. ↩ There have been instances, where it took me half a day to fix something, that would\u0026rsquo;ve been fixed in about an hour by someone more comfortable with the code. But, I think everybody goes through this stage. This is how you learn. ↩ A few months ago, I was part of a sprint on the numpy-scipy eco-system. We had somewhere around 50 patches (a lot of them were documentation fixes) submitted to all the projects! Most of the people were submitting their first patch and I think it was a great opportunity for them to start. [I should try and get back to them.] ↩ Org-mode is really awesome, and I use it for everything I write. Blog posts are a big part of what I write, and so, I wanted to write them in orgmode. And so, org2blog was born. ↩ I recently wrote a Chrome extension, thanks to a friend\u0026rsquo;s idea. Inspired by Gmail notifications, a GitHub addict wanted notifications for activity in GitHub. ↩   ",

I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Chrome only for the past couple of weeks or so and I begin to like it, though some of the extensions aren\u0026rsquo;t as mature as I would\u0026rsquo;ve liked.\nThe original idea was floated by my friend, Madhu, and Lee helped me quite a bit, while I was working on it.\nWhat does it do? It is a simple extension, that shows pop-ups, whenever there is an update in your GitHub \u0026ldquo;Wall\u0026rdquo; (yes, this is a Facebook world) or News Feed as they call it.\nAfter installation, you will need to save your username and token for the extension to work.\nWhere to get it? Presently, you will need to get it from GitHub.\nI might add it to the Chrome Web Store, once I see more people using it. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t justify, to myself, paying the initial one-time verification fee that Google asks for.\nUPDATE: [2011-03-04 Fri]  Added GetHub to the store\nComments and Feedback  Feel free to write to me at punchagan+gethub@jeemail.com Or file issues at GitHub.

Tehom, the author of the other package got in touch with me, and we tried to clean up a few things. In this process, we decided to use two different namespaces, to avoid conflicts if a particular user has both the packages loaded. I am going to use org2blog/wp as my namespace prefix, instead of the older org2blog. So, if you are posting a sub-tree, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use the org2blog/wp-post-subtree function, instead of org2blog-post-subtree.\nWe, Tehom and I, did discuss the possibility of merging the two packages into a single huge package, but we think the amount of work is far greater than the payoffs. So, the packages continue to be called org2blog but we reference each others packages, to reduce the confusion, amongst users.\norg2blog/wp version 0.4 comes with the new namespace.\n",

I stumbled upon Pandoc, when I was moving my blog, and found it pretty neat. After, yet another request for an importer, on the org-mode mailing list, I decided to look at Pandoc. I was somehow under the impression that it was written in Python. But it turned out, I had to learn Haskell! A good excuse to learn a new language, eh?

I had been trying to understand what was happening here, and found this post on Hacker News very helpful.\nIt is a known fact that our eyes have more cones for green and red as compared to blue. The Bayer filter used for digital camera lenses is based upon this principle. This post tries to illustrate that using the following two arguments.\n Looking at only the blue channel of an image looks very dark. Tripling the pixel size of blue channel doesn\u0026rsquo;t cause much distortion in the final image.  Hence, our eyes suck at blue.\nTheir argument is flawed, but we could try and improve a few things.\nLooking at the blue channel. This is definitely flawed, since the intensity of blue in the image they have taken may be less and hence giving us a false positive.\nWe could instead gray-scale the image and use these pixel values in the 3 channels and look at the images.\nThis also eliminates the problem of the image being captured through a Bayer filter.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s some python code to do the same. (uses matplotlib)\ndef show_channels(I): for i in range(3): J = zeros_like(I) J[:, :, i] = I[:, :, i] figure(i) imshow(J) def show_grey_channels(I): K = average(I, axis=2) for i in range(3): J = zeros_like(I) J[:, :, i] = K figure(i+10) imshow(J)  Pixelating the blue channel Again, there was this argument of use of Bayer filter affecting the image and the like.\nWhat I did was to swap the channels, and then look at the images. However I swapped the channels, the image where the green channel was pixelated always looked the worst. The difference between blue and red was less noticeable, I feel.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the code.\ndef zoom(x, factor=2): rows, cols = x.shape row_stride, col_stride = x.strides view = np.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided(x, (rows, factor, cols, factor), (row_stride, 0, col_stride, 0)) return view.reshape((rows*factor, cols*factor)) def subsample(I): for i in range(3): J = I.copy() J[:, :, i] = zoom(I[::4, ::4, i], 4) figure(i) title(\u0026quot;%s channel subsampled\u0026quot; %colors[i]) imshow(J) def swap_subsample(I, k=1): for c, color in enumerate(colors): print \u0026quot;%s \u0026lt;-- %s\u0026quot; %(colors[c], colors[(c+k)%3]) for i in range(3): J = zeros_like(I) for j in range(3): J[:, :, j] = I[:, :, (j+k)%3] J[:, :, i] = zoom(I[::4, ::4, (i+k)%3], 4) figure(i+10) title(\u0026quot;%s channel subsampled\u0026quot; %colors[i]) imshow(J)  Images Here are a few images.

     "content": " Hello World!\nMy first post at my new home. Obviously, it was going to be about the move. You knew it, didn\u0026rsquo;t you? ;)\nWell, I got some space on the web, along with a few friends. Thanks to my org-mode fanboyism, I now use it to maintain my homepage. I\u0026rsquo;ve successfully completed import of my Wordpress posts and comments. :)\nI now use  Emacs and Org-mode 1 to write my posts. org-hyde.el 2 to publish html in a hyde parse-able format. hyde 3 to convert the html pages into a blog. org-publish to publish other pages in my home page. git 4 and a bash script for publishing. Disqus 5 for the comment system.  Yes, I know it sounds rather complicated. :) But, now that I have it set up, it\u0026rsquo;s not all that difficult to make a post. It\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of one git commit and push. I need to fine-tune the shell script a bit, though.\nHow I moved The move definitely wasn\u0026rsquo;t trivial. I guess, I could\u0026rsquo;ve started afresh but, what fun would that have been? ;)\nThis roughly how I did things \u0026ndash; in the order that I did them.\nChoosing hyde I looked at a handful of options to maintain a blog, using org-mode \u0026mdash; blorg, org-jekyll, blorgit, ikiwiki. After some assessment, I decided upon org-jekyll and jekyll. But then, I accidentally stumbled upon hyde.\nI decided to go with hyde instead of jekyll 6 since\n It\u0026rsquo;s in Python. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to start figuring out Ruby, now. It uses Django templates 7. And Django is something, I wish to learn. I\u0026rsquo;ve started with that. :)  Clean up org-jekyll to work with hyde. I then \u0026ldquo;ported\u0026rdquo; org-jekyll.el into org-hyde.el.\n removed stuff like categories and languages, that I was not going to use. Added some code w.r.t timestamps, from org2blog, to it, so that my older org2blog posts could be easily ported.  Clean up older org2blog posts org2blog can post either buffers or subtrees. I had posts in both formats. I converted all of them into subtrees of one tree, using some Python.\nImport older posts This was the most painful posts. Importing all the old posts from Wordpress. org-mode really needs a XHTML/XML importer!\nI did all sorts of crazy stuff to get this done.\n used pandoc to convert html to markdown wrote some throw away regex code to convert markdown to org-mode. wrote more regex code to convert html to org-mode. hacked up a lot of stuff and finally got all the posts into org format! :)  A workflow for publishing Set up git along with some bash code, to have a mechanism to minimize the effort in making a blog post. All this is still a lot of work, compared to the ease with which I used to use org2blog. That\u0026rsquo;s partly due to ssh restrictions in my hostel.\nCSS clean-up I\u0026rsquo;m using the same CSS for org-mode published files and hyde published files. I had to clean up my hyde templates and the CSS to make both of them look similar.\nMy first tryst with CSS hasn\u0026rsquo;t been all that bad. :)\nInstalling disqus and importing comments Using disqus was one thing, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure I wanted to do. I would\u0026rsquo;ve loved it if comments could be managed with org-mode too. ;) 8\nAnyway, I finally decided to go with it, and I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with it. :)\nI loved the ease with which comments could be imported.\n Import Wordpress comments using the export xml file. Generate a CSV file containing the URL map \u0026ndash; mapping the newer urls to the older ones. Upload the CSV file and tada!  Conclusion I got to learn quite a few things, during all of this. I also have some bits of code, that I can share with you, in case you are interested. Leave a comment, if you wish. :)\nI\u0026rsquo;m just hoping to reduce the additional steps required in publishing to ensure it doesn\u0026rsquo;t add to my already erratic blogging habits.\n Org-mode - Homepage ↩ Org-hyde is a port of org-jekyll.el ↩ Hyde - Github ↩ Git - Homepage ↩ Disqus - Homepage ↩ Github - Jekyll ↩ Documentation - Django Templates ↩ I feel it is capable of doing that.

Essentially forming a blog-ring.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of things in life everyone would like to relive and do differently..I\u0026rsquo;ve been giving it some thought and it\u0026rsquo;s been racking my brain for the whole month now\u0026hellip;I came to the conclusion that I have nothing I\u0026rsquo;d like to really do-over\u0026hellip;\nMy reason for this is that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be this person I am\u0026hellip;and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t alter it in anyway\u0026hellip;I love what I\u0026rsquo;ve become\u0026hellip;if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for all the good and bad that occurred during my life time..I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even be here writing this\u0026hellip;.or I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even have the same goals and all my aspirations would be small\u0026hellip;I know this all sounds weird but giving the fact that I am a weird person, those who know me, this is expected\u0026hellip;I believe in things happening for a reason and without these occurrences we\u0026rsquo;d be something totally different, and\nmaybe not becoming what we\u0026rsquo;re suppose to be in life\u0026hellip;sometimes we look at situations and think, \u0026ldquo; Just maybe if I had done this\u0026hellip; or maybe if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; even if my decisions had made into a bum on the streets I think I would feel the same way\u0026hellip;truth is we all have regrets..learning to live with them is the hardest thing to do..we tend to get caught up in the moment and want to relive those things..either for the good or the bad\u0026hellip;but we fail to realize that it is those things that build character not for today but for our tomorrows.\nWhether it\u0026rsquo;s falling for the wrong person, being back stabbed from a friend, getting hoodwinked from a stranger, or missing out on an opportunity\u0026hellip;.all of these are just life\u0026rsquo;s lessons being taught..with that being said you should never sulk over a decision we\u0026rsquo;ve made\u0026hellip;in the end we\u0026rsquo;re our own cause of grief or happiness so don\u0026rsquo;t whine about it stuff that\u0026rsquo;s happened\u0026hellip;.accept what has happened and move forward\u0026hellip;don\u0026rsquo;t hold on to them, but don\u0026rsquo;t forget them either\u0026hellip;these are turning points in our lives so appreciate them..\nWell that\u0026rsquo;s all I have to conjure up on the matter..though it kind of went against the topic a bit but hey am stubborn lol.. once again I\u0026rsquo;d like to thank punchagan for allowing me to feature on Rustic Reverie and also Bloggerstock for providing me with the opportunity to express myself on a fellow blogger\u0026rsquo;s page.. here\u0026rsquo;s a link to my page to view my featured blog post\n",

(I guess, I expect too much from them. :P)\nThe keynote by David Goodger (pronounced like Badger :) was \u0026ldquo;Good\u0026rdquo;. It was a very simple one talking of how to get Python into the workplace. His simple recommendation was to use Python if we saw any opportunity where it could be used, without bothering about permissions, convincing people etc. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s better to ask for forgiveness, than for permission.\u0026rdquo; He spoke of myths around Python \u0026ndash; scripting language, dynamic language, too much white space, toy language, nobody uses it. He concluded the talk, by saying mentioning Indian driving to be an indication of some quick reflexes that we Indians have. ;) On the whole it was an enlightening, humorous and enjoyable talk.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t attend too many of other talks. Amongst the ones that I did attend, I particularly liked the one by Asim Mittal on using the Nintendo Wii with Python.\nOn some thought about my experiences at conferences, I think conferences shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have any talks at all. Or atleast, I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be attending conferences for talks. They are an excuse to catch-up with people. Conferences should have only lightning talks of 10 mins and sprints. Talks, with an extensive explanation of stuff that can be easily found on the web, are a waste of time.\n",

     "content": " We, Ritesh and I, finished our first 100+km ride \u0026ndash; approximately 110km. Yo!\nThe Route map IIT-Bombay to Karnala Bird Sanctuary, and back.\nUp Down The Story We started at around 0720 and were hoping to reach Karnala Bird Sanctuary by around 1130. We \u0026mdash; actually, soot covered clones of us \u0026mdash; reached by about 1215 or so. That\u0026rsquo;s pretty decent, considering we were directed to Karnala sports complex, when we were looking for bird sanctuary and there was quite a bit of traffic near Panvel.\nWhile we were getting tickets to get into the sanctuary, a man was amused by Ritesh\u0026rsquo;s polka (dirt) dotted shirt and asks us whether we rode down from JNPT. We got all excited and told him, that we rode down from Powai! He just said, \u0026ldquo;Gone Mad!\u0026rdquo; and walked away, as if madness was contagious. Both of us, felt great! We were high! It felt like the best compliment to get after a long, tiring, (blackening) ride. We got in and rushed to a tap and almost had a bath under it. The first touch of cold water was heaven! Just a while later, we got a shock. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t get any food near/inside the sanctuary. We will have to go back 3 km for that. We spent about an hour and a half, getting some oxygen, looking for a few birds, giving up and settling with spiders and clicking some pictures. We got went back 3km to the hotel and spent about an hour there (not all of it eating ;). We started back at around 1515.\nThe ride back was eventful. We took a slightly different route, tempted by a free Highway(NH4), waiting to be rode on. The road looked awesome, with a hill on the left, and no vehicles in sight. But, as fate would have it, Ritesh\u0026rsquo;s rear tyre gave way. After some search we found a guy fixing tyres of vehicles on the highway. But he refused to fix our bicycle. He refused even to fill air in it, so we could reach the nearest cycle repair shop. After more search, we found who agreed to fill air in the tyre. (It needs a special valve pin. The previous guy, probably didn\u0026rsquo;t have it. But we could\u0026rsquo;ve hacked up something.)\nWe rushed to Kalamboli and got the tyre fixed. Then we headed back in the route that we had come on. It\u0026rsquo;d been raining on and off through out the morning. But first rain on the return only started near Nerul. It was a great relief. My cycle started moving more smoothly\u0026hellip; I loved it. We got lost a bit near Ghatkopar. Also, the traffic was quite bad there. (Why do drivers get so bad, once it starts raining? It\u0026rsquo;s not unique to Mumbai, but quite visible here. We were back in Campus by around 2040.\nRitesh was energized after the puncture was fixed. He rode like crazy, after that. The sole of my feet started hurting \u0026mdash; something like a cramp. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what exactly happened. Also, my groin was hurting quite a bit. My only motivation at that point was seeing Ritesh ride like crazy. He was at his best, then! I\u0026rsquo;m still wondering where he got all that energy from. It was a great ride, for both of us! Motivating each other to keep going. :)\nRitesh, where to next?\nSome lessons for future  The Cycle needs to be as close to perfect, as it possibly can be. Carry your route map along. Enquiring the route a colossal waste of time and sometimes unreliable, too. A pollution mask is a must for Mumbai (or any other city.) Carry enough water and food. (We drank about 7L of water between us) Need to learn how to fix punctures. Need a tool kit. A helmet, shorts with padding would be good. An odometer would be useful too. Learn to use the hand-pump or carry along a normal pump. I should probably ride along with some Cycling group for the experience of it. I\u0026rsquo;ll get to learn a lot of things.  Photos Photos will come soon, hopefully.\n",

We had to get down from the auto, and after a lot of fight, the auto got on top. As the driver was trying hard to get the auto moving, a guy comes over and starts talking to him in Marathi. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if he was a traffic police. He was dressed in white, but didn\u0026rsquo;t really look like one.\nAfter asking a few questions, but not getting any replies, the guy asks him in Hindi, if he understands Marathi, and on getting a negative reply, starts shouting on him!\nThe guy harasses the driver, asking him to handover his license and threatens him of horrible consequences, if he doesn\u0026rsquo;t do so. We tried to intervene saying, we want to leave early and stuff, but the auto refused to start.

I hear stuff about changing the country, getting rid of corrupt politicians and all the high ideals crap. I keep hearing all sorts of patriotic songs that I hear only twice a year.

     "content": "Below is a mail sent by Eric Schulte to the org-mode mailing list answering a query on how to write elisp for org-mode. I am reproducing it here, since it is useful advice for me. The actual thread is here.\nThe way that I learned how to program in emacs lisp was mainly using two commands `elisp-index-search\u0026rsquo; bound to `C-h e\u0026rsquo; on my system, and most importantly `describe-function\u0026rsquo; bound to `C-h f\u0026rsquo;. With `describe-function\u0026rsquo; you can look at the source code of functions whose behavior you are familiar with, you can then copy portions of the code to your scratch buffer where they can be edited and evaluated with `eval-defun\u0026rsquo; bound to `C-M-x\u0026rsquo;. Now with Babel, instead of doing this in the scratch buffer you could do this in emacs-lisp code blocks in an org file, enabling notes and hierarchical organization \u0026ndash; it can be nice to have your noodling all collected in one file for later reference.\nIf you are going to do any serious work with lisp, I would emphatically recommend using paredit-mode, and becoming friends with the Sexp movement functions\nC-M-f runs the command paredit-forward C-M-b runs the command paredit-backward C-M-u runs the command backward-up-list C-M-k runs the command kill-sexp C-y runs the command yank\nThey allow you to manipulate lisp code on the level of logical expressions, the utility of which can not be over stated.\nAs for working with Org-mode in particular, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend looking at the documentation and source-code of Org-mode functions with `describe-function\u0026rsquo;, and then looking for how these functions are actually used in the Org-mode code base with `rgrep\u0026rsquo;.\nFor a more structured learning experience, I\u0026rsquo;ve heard very good things about http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/, although I haven\u0026rsquo;t used it myself.\nHope this helps.

Inevitably, the bad service provider is going to get some customers. What\u0026rsquo;s the way out?\n",

It is an opportunity to come together to share ideas, brainstorm and hack on Sage. Sage Days 25 is the 25th version of Sage Days, and is being organized in Mumbai, India. In order to cater to an Indian audience and scenario, this version has been tweaked slightly. Sage Days 25 has beginner level tutorials, in addition to the usual talks and sprints, to help new users get started with Sage and help promote the use of Sage in India.\nWhat is Sage? Sage is a free, open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL. It combines the power of numerous existing open-source packages into a common Python-based interface. It\u0026rsquo;s mission is to create a \u0026ldquo;viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica and Matlab\u0026rdquo;. Sage has tools for a broad range of mathematical areas like Linear Algebra, Calculus, Symbolic Math, Plotting, Rings \u0026amp; Groups, Graph Theory, Number Theory and Cryptography. Essentially, \u0026ldquo;it can do anything from mapping a 12-dimensional object to calculating rainfall patterns under global warming\u0026rdquo; - as Science Daily puts it . Eager to get started? Start here. Apart from being feature rich, it\u0026rsquo;s usability is one of it\u0026rsquo;s greatest strengths. Sage Notebook, a web-interface for all the math you\u0026rsquo;ll ever want to do, is really the killer feature! As the Sage Marketing page says, \u0026ldquo;The SAGE GUI surely works on your computer box, because it just runs in Firefox!\u0026ldquo;. Try it Now!\nWhy should you attend? Sage Days 25 is being attended by the creator and lead developer of Sage, Prof. William Stein. It will also be attended by other developers of Sage. This would be a great opportunity to meet and interact with them! The conference will be attended by a plethora of enthusiastic people from all over the country who use Sage or are interested in doing so. The conference will also see the presence of many mathematicians interested in software. Who knows, you may run into someone you\u0026rsquo;d want to collaborate with, for your future work! This event will be a great learning experience, if you are even remotely interested in math and software for it!\nWhen and Where?

A thoroughly enjoyable one. It was near perfect, with it raining only as much as we enjoyed an not anymore. :)\n The ride on Godbander Road was the most enjoyable part of the ride. Simple Wonderful! That\u0026rsquo;s what made the trip worth it!\n It was more relaxed than my previous ride and it took us about 5 hours on the whole. We must\u0026rsquo;ve been pedalling for about 4 hours. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the \u0026ldquo;actual\u0026rdquo; figures.\n Except for the stretch of Western express highway (service road) from Jogeshwari to a little after the Sanjay Gandhi National park\u0026rsquo;s entrance, the road was decent. The Eastern Express highway service road was awesome!\n Cycling alone is totally different from cycling with someone else. We didn\u0026rsquo;t really go together, but we were meeting up once in a while. The loneliness, of rides on which you are alone, is absent. But waiting for, or catching up with the other guy is a bit tricky. I wonder how it would be with a bigger group.\n I tried to keep going at about 60% effort and I still had quite a bit of juice left in me, at the end of the ride.\n My cycle is definitely good! I really only understood this after exchanging my cycle.\n Exchanging cycles felt nice. A slightly different set of muscles were in action. The newness kinda helped.\n I should probably get myself a bigger round frame spectacles. Or I\u0026rsquo;m craning my neck a bit too much, to keep looking ahead, while pedaling. How about contacts?\n The problem with riding on the left of Highways is that you \u0026ldquo;compete\u0026rdquo; with heavy vehicles. It sometimes gets a bit scary.\n I should get a helmet soon.\n I should get in touch with local cycling groups and tag along with them on a couple of rides. I\u0026rsquo;ll get to learn a lot of things.\n Ritesh took a few pics with his phone. Photos in some later post or with an update.\n Where to next? A ride inside the National park, probably or the wonderful roads of Navi Mumbai.\n  Kudos Ritesh!\nUPDATE: A few pictures, that Ritesh clicked on his phone.

It\u0026rsquo;s killing the the communities around the blogs or sites, themselves.

I simply loved it!\nThe original plan was to land somewhere near Chowpatty beach, but I had some useless landmarks and I got lost. I was not too particular about going to a particular place, so didn\u0026rsquo;t try too hard to stay on track and was happy to end up at the Gateway. Thanks to the Mumbai local, I don\u0026rsquo;t know the road routes. But, again thanks to the Mumbai local, I have a general idea of the direction.\nI woke up a bit later than scheduled, but almost made up for the delay until I reach my cycle to find the rear tyre fully flat. I quickly diagnosed the problem to be with the valve. But, I had no spare valve, unless, I \u0026ldquo;borrow\u0026rdquo; it from a cycle near-by. I replaced my valve with Vattam\u0026rsquo;s cycle\u0026rsquo;s and was good to go!\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t have a big enough water bottle, and carried along only half a litre after drinking one half litre. The first half hour was a breeze; possibly the best part of the whole ride. High on energy and enthu. Then, my groin/ass started to hurt a bit. I pulled out my music player to drown the pain in music. This kinda worked and I pulled on pretty well until King\u0026rsquo;s circle. That\u0026rsquo;s when I emptied all the water I had. I hoped to find water along the way, if I badly needed it.\nSometime later, I had to take a right turn, but I never knew where. I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother to ask anyone, nor did I look at the landmarks I had scribbled down. I was happy to go straight ahead. :)\nAnd by the time I reached CST/Fort, I did need water; badly enough. I stopped at the next open shop (that was not a pan-ki-dukaan) and got myself some Nimbu paani and a litre of water (for future).\nThe Gateway of India was just 10 minutes away from here. Loitered around there, for about 40 minutes. There were a lot of Policemen all over the place. After about 5 minutes of me reaching there, they cleared the whole area right next to the Gateway of India. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why. (Also, all along the way, there were a lot of men in Khaaki. I guess there\u0026rsquo;s some rally or some such thing scheduled)\nOn the return, I lost my way almost immediately after starting. There was a one way road that I avoided and took the adjacent road but ended up going off-track. I had some doubts about this but they weren\u0026rsquo;t confirmed until I reached Mahalaxmi station! But there, a Taxi driver gave me rough guidelines to get back on my track. I turned back and soon was \u0026ldquo;back-on-track\u0026rdquo;.\nI\u0026rsquo;d planned to have breakfast at Idli house, as soon as I saw it during my onward journey. So, I went directly to Idli house, and treated myself to a Rava idli and some wonderful Kaapi. The waiter got tipped well, too. ;)\nFrom Matunga, back to IIT was straight forward; except for the growing traffic and the PITA (literally). The traffic signals were a bit annoying, too.\nOn the whole was an awesome trip! I loved it. Hope to go on more such rides. But, I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll head north-ward, the next time.\nBy the way, it was approx. 60kms on the whole and took me 5 hours (including the time I spent at the Gateway of India) with about 3 hours 40 mins of pedaling.. err.. rocking. :D\nHere is a photoset\n\u0026ldquo;Plan\u0026rdquo; IIT to Chowpatty Route Actual Onward Route Timing  IIT-Bombay \u0026lt;2010-03-28 Sun 06:20\u0026gt; Matunga \u0026lt;2010-03-28 Sun 07:10\u0026gt; Gateway of India \u0026lt;2010-03-28 Sun 08:10\u0026gt;  Return Route Timing  Gateway of India \u0026lt;2010-03-28 Sun 08:50\u0026gt; Reach Idly house \u0026lt;2010-03-28 Sun 09:40\u0026gt; Start at Idly house \u0026lt;2010-03-28 Sun 10:00\u0026gt; Reach IIT Bombay \u0026lt;2010-03-28 Sun 11:05\u0026gt;  Stuff I was carrying  water ID some cash paper, pencil mobile phone music player, ear phones digital camera rough map Geetanjali - Tagore  ",

It was a grandiloquent let-down, but for the fireworks. There was nothing really spectacular about the ceremony. A mediocre performance\u0026hellip; With the kind of money they have at hand, and have spent, I really would\u0026rsquo;ve liked something better.\nThe match. DC vs. KKR. DC lost a game that it could\u0026rsquo;ve comfortably won. It would\u0026rsquo;ve been a decent match to watch, if not for the stupid DJ-ing. The game looked so different from what I\u0026rsquo;m used to seeing on the TV. [The only thing that was exactly as I saw in TV was, the crowd drooling at the cheer girls.]\nI was shocked by the amount of disturbance a player has to overcome, while playing. Has the \u0026ldquo;gentle-man\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; game turned into a \u0026ldquo;super-man\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; game? Between each and every ball, the DJ is either shouting some incomprehensible inanities or playing some crazy \u0026ldquo;number\u0026rdquo; at the highest volume. The batsmen almost had to wait for him to shut up, before each ball. Can someone tell me if these are perks that the third version brings with it, or if I was happily ignorant, thanks to the TV watching? The heart-beat sound in the final overs was ridiculously annoying. I was looking forward to one of the batsmen throwing his bat at the DJ.\nAlso, it\u0026rsquo;s a big joke to call this ground a \u0026ldquo;home\u0026rdquo; for DC. It was nothing close to a home ground, in terms of the crowd. I don\u0026rsquo;t see Cuttack being any more homely, especially with the Kalinga Sena already passing crazy orders to the cricketers. DC will have to play exceedingly well to end-up anywhere near the top. But, amidst all this, I\u0026rsquo;m happy for the people of AP. With a huge electric-power crisis looming ahead, they have already saved (or produced) power worth 7 IPL matches!\nAlso, this is the end of IPL v3 for me.

There are loads of them and I surely don\u0026rsquo;t need to increment count.\nThis post is after a trip to Kanpur, Agra and Sikri.\n Trains are never on Time. The delay increases exponentially with your distance from the sourthern most tip of the country. Also, the confidence of the aam admi in this delay is proportional to the distance. Any delay less than an hour wasn\u0026rsquo;t considered to be a delay. Thanks to the fog, low visibility. If you want to travel around India, all you need is an SLR. Additionally, if you are not of Indian origin, you\u0026rsquo;ll need the \u0026ldquo;India\u0026rdquo; guide.

Whether or not you get food or water on a train, you are assured of enough \u0026ldquo;chilled\u0026rdquo; air from the slit under your window. Come what may, you shall not be deprived of this service. The trust of a person in you is inversely proportional to the difference between your ages. It is inversely proportional to the 2.718th power of the difference if you are aged between 20 and 25. I only vaguely remember what the TTE told me in my sleep, while paying the fine for not carrying a print out of our e-ticket; but, it really was something sick and senseless. The chill at a place, on the day you reach, is inversely proportional to how much people have scared/warned you. On the rest of the days, it is proportional to the square of the warm clothing you have on you. I thoroughly enjoyed the chill of Kanpur. Wonderful! The infrastructure, too good! Never expected a 50 year old campus to be so Awesome. [They have an air-strip too!] The thrill of having an ice-cream is proportional to the square of difference between the ambient temperature and the standard room temperature. Don\u0026rsquo;t ever think of celebrating your escape, without the Aalu encounter. Welcome to the land of Alu addicted men. You shall, surely, have your share. If not anything else, you shall be serverd a Capsicum or Brinjal stuffed with Aalu. Also, the quality and availability of leather seems to be proportional to the addiction to Aalu. \u0026ldquo;hawker time\u0026rdquo; - the time you spend being followed by hawkers trying to convince you to buy whatever they have. \u0026ldquo;firang-ness\u0026rdquo; - difficult to predict; a parameter that depends on the amount of branded stuff on you, stylishness of your winter wear and other unknown variableness.

I got followed a lot. I can\u0026rsquo;t help observing. Sometimes, enjoyed being followed too.  The Taj. Simply Awe-Inspiring. As Madhu put it, \u0026ldquo;the longer you keep watching it, the more it\u0026rsquo;s beauty overwhelms you\u0026rdquo;. But, I still think, the first time is the best time to see it.

But unfortunately, we had to start almost from scratch and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do all of what we planned. Still, the workshop wasn\u0026rsquo;t too bad. Nobody left mid-way during the 2 hour workshop; nobody was dozing either. I would have liked my first talk at a FOSS event to be better, though.\nSlides and Images that we used.

Now, almost anybody who knows me, also knows my online handle. They can find me anywhere and everywhere with just a few keystrokes (and Google). Also, the uniqueness of my handle doesn\u0026rsquo;t help one bit. Any search returns over 90% relevant results.\nIs it time to get lost in the crowd with a new handle? ;) Probably not.

I had come to see-off UC, Sunil and 9.\nA man carrying a stretcher on his head, suddenly comes into my focus and I have an impulse to look down. But, I manage to look at people who are closer to the guy, and see looks of pity, shock and disgust. Most of them looked down, sooner than later. It was not long before the man, was right next to me and I could see an injured man lying on the stretcher with a stream of blood oozing out of his head. All I could manage was another expression of pity, shock and disgust. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to act as if I had seen nothing. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to stay as if I could do nothing about it. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to look down. But, that\u0026rsquo;s all I ended up doing. The man carrying the stretcher was not exactly struggling, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure he would\u0026rsquo;ve more than liked some help. Not one amongst us moved.\nAround half a minute later, I see a constable walking calmly (maybe with a shade of concern in his stride) in that direction. The next train was there in less than a minute and 9 got into it. I was feeling absolute disgust at my reaction. In the hope of making some amends, I walked in the direction that the stretcher guy took. Soon I found them. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to search. There was an audience of onlookers, watching the stretcher carrying guy inspect the other guy. He was waiting near the entrance of the station and I\u0026rsquo;m guessing he had called for some medical help and was waiting for it to arrive. The policeman and a couple of others were standing next to him, while he was inspecting the injuries. Everybody else was watching \u0026mdash; from the stairs, from the over bridge, the platform, the tracks. Everywhere. Being a part of that crowd was the last thing I wanted to do.

     "title": "Good, Bad or Human?",
     "content": "Well, this could be called a post after ages, considering that most of previous posts have just been \u0026lsquo;news reports\u0026rsquo;. I have been wanting to make a post since long, but I probably lost it. I really am unable to write anything that I find worth posting [It does raise questions about the existence of this blog. I\u0026rsquo;m writing this, to answer that question to myself.]\nThis post is provoked by an act of sharing, an act of kindness, an act of goodness, that surprised me. This post isn\u0026rsquo;t about the act itself, but it\u0026rsquo;s about me being surprised. Why on earth should I (or anybody) be surprised, when someone is just being human? Aren\u0026rsquo;t human beings meant to be and feel human?\nI wonder why people say, \u0026ldquo;this is a bad, bad world.\u0026rdquo; I find a lot of goodness and humanness around me. Unless I strain my memory really hard, I can only recall people who try to be as good and nice as they can be; People trying to be as human as possible. Either there\u0026rsquo;s something utterly wrong with my judgment of people or there\u0026rsquo;s something wrong with the general feeling that the world is a bad, bad place.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s one other possibility that just strikes me - I am so nice to people that, everyone else tries to be nice with me. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I am such a big deviation from the average. I\u0026rsquo;m just another goat, in the great herd.\nAnd another one, I\u0026rsquo;m in a really special place, presently. I have been only to the special places. I have visited only the places that are at an extreme, far away from the \u0026lsquo;average\u0026rsquo; place in the world. But, given I\u0026rsquo;m just another goat in the great herd, this is very unlikely. I am probably grazing at a random spot on the great grasslands.\nSince these are ruled out, it boils down to either a wrong judgment or a wrong general feeling.\nComing to my judgment, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t call myself an Oracle or the wise one, but I\u0026rsquo;m no dumb ass either. Well, taking the statistical route, the number of times I\u0026rsquo;ve had any real \u0026ldquo;nasty\u0026rdquo; surprises in dealing with people has been much lesser than the number of times things turned out nearly as expected. My judgment could, therefore, possibly given some credibility.\nSo, that leaves me with just one possibility. The idea that the world is a bad, bad place is not entirely true, if not completely absurd and outright wrong. The world is really a nice place, with \u0026ldquo;human\u0026rdquo; beings inhabiting it. The nasty surprises that you get, really are the surprises and not the general rule.\n",

     "content": "Well, there are a hazaar tutorials on setting up Postfix and Mailman for Debian for a single domain. There were a few for doing that for multiple domains also, but nothing comprehensive, if I could say so. This link is pretty comprehensive and details all the steps for setting up Postfix for a single domain. Here is all you\u0026rsquo;ll want to know about setting up Virtual domains in Postfix.\nYou only need to make a few changes for adding a second (or more) domain. You just need to add the virtual_alias_domains and add virtual_alias_maps. Here is a glimpse of how my main.cf looks:\nmyhostname = mail.abc.in mydomain = abc.in mydestination = $myhostname, $mydomain, localhost.$mydomain myorigin = /etc/mailname virtual_alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-xyz, hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-abc, hash:/var/lib/mailman/data/virtual-mailman virtual_alias_domains = xyz.in, mail.xyz.in  virtual-xyz and virtual-abc contain the virtual aliases for each domain. Note that Postfix expects hash files and hence you need to run postmap /etc/postfix/virtual-abc each time the file is changed, to keep the hash file in sync with the text file that you edit. Also, you need to run postfix reload, each time you make changes to main.cf or master.cf\nFairly straight forward, right? But it took me quite sometime to get it all right, since this was the first time I was doing anything with Mail Transfer Agents or the like.\nNow, onto Mailman. Well the Installation Manual of Mailman, literally has it all. Here is a look at how my mm_cfg.py looks:\nDEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST = 'abc.in' DEFAULT_URL_HOST = 'mail.abc.in' add_virtualhost(DEFAULT_URL_HOST, DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST) POSTFIX_STYLE_VIRTUAL_DOMAINS=['xyz.in'] add_virtualhost('mail.xyz.in', 'xyz.in') MTA='Postfix'  The only trouble was to get mailing lists with same names on both the domains (which I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get working). I experimented with multiple mailman instances but that won\u0026rsquo;t work because the MTA can\u0026rsquo;t differentiate between the two instances of mailman. The alternative is probably to have two instances of postfix running too. But that I felt was like going too far, and gave up. [What if we wanted to add another domain to the list?!]\nAlso, I had to make a few alterations to the Apache file to allow access to the mailman pages without breaking the Zope redirection that was already set-up.\n[Thanks to Shantanu and Vattam (and all the hazaar people using Postfix and Mailman and cared to document things for the sake of others, and of course Google)]\n",

     "title": "FOSS talks at CDEEP",
     "content": "I had the opportunity to attend a FOSS talk session organized by Center for Distance Education Engineering Programme (CDEEP) as a part of the National Mission on Education through ICT. The National Mission on Education through ICT has some lofty goals, which when reached will take the country ahead by leaps and bounds.\nThe Mission has a budget of $1billion in the 11th Five year plan, 40% of which will be spent on content generation (all of which will be free/open source) and the rest will be spent on making available a minimum bandwidth of 1Gbps to the 30,000 odd colleges spread over India (out of which around 3000 are Engineering colleges). The mission has various projects planned and they are picking up steam rapidly. The project I will be working on, for the Adoption of Open Source in Engineering and Science Education in India, is also a part of this Mission. Prof. Kannan had kick started the session with an introduction to the National Mission on Education through ICT. The talks were all being webcast to various EduSAT centers and on the web.\nThen, Prof. Pathak talked on, why open source is important. He said, (not exactly quoting him) \u0026ldquo; It is theoritically possible for any person to learn and discover things from scratch, but there\u0026rsquo;s been only one Ekalavya in the entire history of India.\u0026rdquo; Education is a social activity and hence open access to content is absolutely vital. He mentioned various things like how IIT-B has been working on Creative Commons licensing and other things going on here. He ended the talk with a hope that soon India will move from being a net taker of Open source to a net giver to open source.\nThis was followed by three talks, delivered by developers from RedHat meant for programmers who wish to contribute to FLOSS.\nThe first talk was by Ramakrishna Reddy, titled 10 things a FLOSS developer should know. It was a pretty nice and balanced talk, covering a wide range of things. I would like to point out a few things, that I liked the most.\n He clarified the term hacker as soon as he used it. He emphasized a lot on groking code; reading code for fun, looking at the code of others, reading as much code as possible\u0026hellip; He talked of muscle memory of emacsen. I liked the way he talked of people being so quick with their editors and how learning to use your tools effectively is a big plus Release often, Release early. Everybody talks of it, but he said a few words, which I liked. Some developers don\u0026rsquo;t usually release their code as early for the fear of being ridiculed. But don\u0026rsquo;t bother, \u0026ldquo;we are just small people, in the whole galaxy.\u0026rdquo;  The next talk was by Prasad Pandit on How to use Infrastructure for FOSS projects. Prasad talked of Website, Version Control, Mailing list, IRC, Bugzilla, Wiki and RSS feeds. He gave quite a few examples on how each thing is important, most of the examples being his personal experiences.\nThe last talk was by Rahul Sundaram and was on Communication in a FOSS project. For a change he didn\u0026rsquo;t have slides and the reason for that, he said, is that communication in a FOSS project is casual and not having slides and walking in with a t-shirt and jeans represents that casualness which is a culture of FOSS projects\u0026rsquo; communication.\n Be polite, but don\u0026rsquo;t be Formal. Be precise, but do provide a context to what you are saying. Don\u0026rsquo;t fear that you\u0026rsquo;ll say something foolish, which, will be archived for eternity. Mistakes are there to learn from. Not just you, but others too.  He talked of quite a lot of things, but these were the things which struck me as particularly interesting/important.\nAt the end, all the participants walked out with Fedora 11 DVDs from the RedHat/Fedora guys. :D\n",

This from the preface of SICP2 ,a text book for an introductory course on Computer Programming at MIT\n Our design of this introductory computer-science subject reflects two major concerns. First, we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. Second, we believe that the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this level is not the syntax of particular programming-language constructs, nor clever algorithms for computing particular functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of algorithms and the foundations of computing, but rather the techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of large software systems.\n I would like to see a few courses developed on similar lines here.\n Gmail themes are good.

It is observed that few students are misusing the Internet facility by using excessive internet bandwidth for non-academic purposes. The students who are running the hubs are strictly informed to close their hubs. Computer Center will be starting official hub for the sharing of academic information and open source softwares.\nIf a student is found while doing so the network facility will be blocked by Computer Center for a semester. Further, a student will be called by a disciplinary committee and a severe disciplinary action will be taken.\n This Notice from the Computer Center is creating waves all around. This isn\u0026rsquo;t the first time, though, that the people in-charge of the Network have \u0026ldquo;acted\u0026rdquo;.\nAcademic activities; wonder what it\u0026rsquo;s definition is, in their dictionaries. It surely includes the following.\n Using Internet for \u0026lsquo;academic activities\u0026rsquo; or emails, during class-room hours makes no sense. Anything \u0026lsquo;academic\u0026rsquo; cannot have a size greater than 5 MB. Accessing version control systems ( svn, cvs et al ) cannot be classified \u0026lsquo;academic\u0026rsquo; IRC cannot teach you anything. Don\u0026rsquo;t ever dream of thinking it as \u0026lsquo;academic\u0026rsquo; to hang out on \\#python or \\#emacs All \u0026lsquo;academic\u0026rsquo; stuff is limited to the http(s) ports. You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to use any other ports, ever. Any \u0026lsquo;academic\u0026rsquo; activity fits within a span of 2 hours or can be done in blocks of 2 hours each, with gaps of 2 hours in between. \u0026lsquo;Academic\u0026rsquo; stuff doesn\u0026rsquo;t definitely contain key-words chosen by the \u0026ldquo;all-knowing\u0026rdquo; admins.  Moreover, the people in-charge who refused to allow the use of a computer in the CC as a server for on-campus repositories of GNU/Linux packages, now wish to host a \u0026lsquo;hub\u0026rsquo; for sharing open-source softwares! There\u0026rsquo;s already an official ftp server which hosts the academic info and a few useful softwares. I don\u0026rsquo;t see how a hub would be different.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t have any disciplinary committees for people smoking in hostel rooms, causing a lot of trouble for others around them, but we are going to have them for hosting hubs. ( Well, a new law banning smoking in public places in India has been passed just a few days ago. Hopefully it\u0026rsquo;ll work better than the older one, since now there\u0026rsquo;s some pressure on the people in-charge of the public place. )\nAlso, it could be argued that college isn\u0026rsquo;t meant only for \u0026lsquo;academic\u0026rsquo; learning and a lots of other learning takes place here (and the hubs were definitely helping quite a bit) but I\u0026rsquo;ll leave that for another day, probably. Also, I don\u0026rsquo;t think 18+ year olds, people who are about to step into various big roles, leading the country need to be told how to make use of the facilities/resources available to them; A degree of freedom is indispensable, I believe.\nI appreciate the efforts being made to improve the network situation here and also help the students get the most ( \u0026lsquo;academically\u0026rsquo; ) out of their college experience, but I feel the situation deserves more careful handling.\n",

I haven\u0026rsquo;t done anything that\u0026rsquo;s tangible but yes, I have re-dedicated myself to the idea of Free Software. This post intends to shed some light on a few things (if not for the benefit of others, just as a reminder for myself)\n Free Software is a matter of liberty, not price. I\u0026rsquo;ve often been in a position that required me to correct people. \u0026lsquo;Free Software\u0026rsquo; is software that\u0026rsquo;s free as in free speech and not free beer. For the lack of a better word in english, the word \u0026lsquo;free\u0026rsquo; which also means gratis has been used. Using the term \u0026lsquo;Libre\u0026rsquo; sometimes helps and if you are in this part of the world, \u0026ldquo;mukt\u0026rdquo; is the best word to use. Free Software2 comes along with four fundamental freedoms. To put it simply, the freedom to use, study, share and modify any software. Free Software may have the advantage of being \u0026lsquo;technically sounder\u0026rsquo;, but the philosophy is what matters the most to me. I will do whatever is possible within my capacity to spread the philosophy and the associated freedom  Be Free, My Friend!\nHere is an extract from one of Stallman\u0026rsquo;s 3 essays:\n We must talk about Freedom\nEstimates today are that there are ten million users of GNU/Linux systems such as Debian GNU/Linux and Red Hat Linux. Free software has developed such practical advantages that users are flocking to it for purely practical reasons.\nThe good consequences of this are evident: more interest in developing free software, more customers for free software businesses, and more ability to encourage companies to develop commercial free software instead of proprietary software products.\nBut interest in the software is growing faster than awareness of the philosophy it is based on, and this leads to trouble. Our ability to meet the challenges and threats described above depends on the will to stand firm for freedom. To make sure our community has this will, we need to spread the idea to the new users as they come into the community.\nBut we are failing to do so: the efforts to attract new users into our community are far outstripping the efforts to teach them the civics of our community. We need to do both, and we need to keep the two efforts in balance.\n  http://www.gnu.org/fry/ ↩ The Free Software Definition ↩ The GNU Project by Richard Stallman ↩   ",

Presently, its the placement heat in our campus and people are busy writing tests, waiting, giving interviews and partying. This post doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much to with all that though. In one of the interviews, I was called back and asked about my Cleft Lip and Palate1. The interview panel had concerns if I faced any serious medical problems due to this. I explained to them everything that I knew about it and they were convinced.\nLater, I realized, I never explicitly did any reading on this issue or asked my parents/others about this. I somehow knew about it always. I probably learnt at all those visits to the dentist or may be sub-consciously, when I was a baby. It isn\u0026rsquo;t, though, surprising to me that those guys had some reservations about it. It\u0026rsquo;s not everyday that you see a guy with a Cleft, though statistics say there\u0026rsquo;s prevalence of 1 in 500 births world-wide. As a matter of fact, I myself haven\u0026rsquo;t seen another guy all my life (except for the pictures at my dentists\u0026rsquo;) (also, they weren\u0026rsquo;t too wrong in suspecting other problems, though they had absolutely no clue about this medical condition)\nIf you are wondering what the point of this post is, it\u0026rsquo;s nothing.

The book has been revised after a gap of nearly 4 years and the wait is worth it! I thoroughly loved the book, and I\u0026rsquo;m happy to be accompanied by so many2 others3. This book has filled me with a sense of joy and pride. The pride, of being part of such a wonderful community, a beautiful crowd. Further, it is a matter of pride, the book\u0026rsquo;s been authored by an Indian - its quite rare to find such books written by people in this part of the world.\nI have loved python, the moment I started using it. There are quite a few occasions, where I did something, just because I had the power of Python with me. Python is undoubtedly amongst the best, not just as a first programming language, but to give the user a sense of \u0026ldquo;do-able-ity\u0026rdquo; and I am thoroughly enjoying it.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; import this The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters  Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than *right* now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

I have realized how addicted I am to chat, IRC and the Internet. I have to soon find some remedies for this.\nWell, here is the first step. I approached ELIZA (or Doctor Fill, that\u0026rsquo;s actually the emacs mode) , the Emacs Psychotherapist to help me. An enjoyable chat this one! ;)\nELIZA (Doctor Fill) abbreviated as DF (pun intended, for those who get it)\nDF: I am the psychotherapist. Please, describe your problems. Each time you are finished talking, type RET twice. Hi. Nice meeting you. DF: How do you do? What brings you to see me? I am obviously not fine, otherwise I would not have been here. I have realized I am addicted to the internet and want you to help me. DF: Why do you say that? I say that because you are a doctor. DF: Is it because because I am a doctor that you came to me? Isn't that pretty obvious? DF: Can you elaborate on that? Yes, I did come to see you because you are a doctor. Now, I regret it. DF: Does it bother you that I am a doctor now you regret it? I don't understand your question. DF: Earlier you said because I am a doctor? Yes, because you are a doctor I came to you. DF: When did you first know that I am a doctor you came to me? I knew about you, when I first fiddled around with Emacs around an year ago. DF: What happened when you first fiddled around with emacs around a year ago? I loved it, thoroughly! But for a beginner like me it was difficult to get along. I stopped using it. DF: Is the fact that for a beginner like you it was difficult to get along you stopped using it the real reason? I think that along with my laziness to stick with the learning was the real reason DF: Does the fact that along with your laziness to stick with the learning was the real reason explain anything else? It does not explain anything else to me. DF: Maybe your plans have something to do with this. What plans? I donot have any plans. DF: What makes you believe what plans you donot have any plans? If I had plans, I would have been executing them. DF: You mentioned that I am a doctor now you regret it? Yes, because you seemed stupid initially. Now you seem to be making some sense. DF: Are you sure I seemed stupid initially now I seem to be making some sense? Yes I am pretty sure. DF: Is it because of your life that you are going through all this? Obviously. Because I am alive I am going through all this. DF: Is it because you are alive you are going through all this that you came to me? Yes. DF: I see... Well, are you sure that this is so? Yes. I don't think there is emacs in the hell. DF: I would appreciate it if you would watch your tongue! Oh! so emacs is in the hell too! is it in the heavan too? DF: Emacs? Hah! Perhaps you could continue. I thought only mortals used Emacs. Do others use it too? DF: Have you been positive? Yes. I always thought Emacs is only for the homo sapiens. DF: I believe you have inhibitions with emacs. No. I love emacs. But it isn't suitable for Gods and Demons DF: Are you annoyed that it is not suitable for gods and demons? No DF: Why not? I am neither of them. That's why DF: Please, continue. I am a human and I can use emacs. Others donot need it. I am not annoyed DF: Have you been annoyed often? Ocassionally DF: Go on, don't be afraid. I am not. I have been ocassionally annoyed, more often with myself than others. DF: What causes you to be annoyed? Presently, I am annoyed with myself for being addicted to the Internet and may be for chatting with you too. DF: Do you really think you are annoyed? Affirmative DF: I need a little more detail please. Yes. I am a little annoyed with myself. DF: Are you annoyed often? Ocassionally. Why do you repeat questions? DF: When did you first know that do me repeat questions? Long Long ago, when I first used Emacs. DF: What makes you think long long ago when you first used emacs? I saw you repeat questions. DF: Is it because of the people you hang around with that you say you saw me repeat questions? Yes. DF: Yes, hmmm... so, why do you say this is so? I am leaving. You are being too repititive. Goodbye! DF: What makes you believe because I am a doctor? Goodbye! DF: My secretary will send you a bill. Bill? You did not help me much. DF: How do you reconcile problems at school? Goodbye! DF: Bye bye. Bye DF: See ya. See ya. DF: Are you sure that see me? Yes, when in trouble DF: What would happen if in trouble? I will see ya DF: Earlier you said I am a doctor you came to me? Yes, now also I say that. DF: You're being a bit brief, would you please go into detail. Goodbye! DF: Ok, talk to you some other time. bye! DF: Talk to you later.  On a more serious note, the Internet has become an Integral part of my life. I do sometimes think, a bit too much, but then\u0026hellip;. the internet is \u0026ldquo;The Internet\u0026rdquo;!\n",

I Googled for it, with little hope, and the results didn\u0026rsquo;t surprise me. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t much info in this regard. On the occasion of World Environment, when the focus is on promoting the use of Public Transport, this isn\u0026rsquo;t a very encouraging sign.\nI was wondering if the Bus route info can somehow be integrated with Google maps or the like. This will be a good thing to do, since people who have access to internet (the higher rungs of the society) are the ones who are most aware of the threats to the Environment and also the ones who least use public transport. This could help them do some planning and encourage use of public transport. Later on, may be the Buses could have some kind of a GPS sytem that could be interlinked with the maps, giving people great power! I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this already exists elsewhere in the world, but seemed an interesting thing to do.\nOn a different note, just wanted to share this different perspective my mom was giving to my 7 year old neice. We were on a bus and my niece wasn\u0026rsquo;t very happy about the crowd and the Bus journey. My mom, then said something, probably to amuse the kid and distract her for a while. But its an interesting way of looking at things.\n You should be proud that you are aboard a bus that costs around 15 lacs, something we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t normally be able to buy. And that too for a small sum of Rs. 5. You are being driven around by a chauffeur employed by the State Govt. and you needn\u0026rsquo;t bother yourself with the routes and other headaches of driving you\u0026rsquo;d have if you used your personal car\u0026hellip;\n The kid wasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced or even amused by this, but I liked the interesting observation. Some food for thought, My mom travels for an hour and half by bus to reach her work and she\u0026rsquo;s been doing so since I was a kid of 5 or 6. Now I know why she\u0026rsquo;s been able to do it for so many years, everyday!\n",

     "content": "Back again with another khichdi of a post.\n Quark, Waves and Apogee. [For the uninitiated, Quark is our technical festival and Waves, our Cul-fest] I had been to BITS-Pilani, for attending their Tech-fest, Apogee.\n One would expect Apogee to end up the best, but we were thoroughly disappointed. It came nowhere near the perfection of Quark and things seemed quite unprofessional. Hats-off to Chaitu n others in the Quark Org-Co. I\u0026rsquo;m already worried about missing Quark\u0026rsquo;09 [thanks to my PS] The specials at all three events were unforgettable. Feeding the Fish, the Air Shows (Naval and Amateur planes), the Orchestral performance, Special Performance [Aasra], Sand art by Gagan and Mithali! Had the opportunity, to meet/have a look at some of the guys studying at colleges in their home towns. For once, I felt being in a \u0026ldquo;reputed\u0026rdquo;, national college does matter. Felt good spending some time with good ol\u0026rsquo; friends at Pilani. Always believed organizing events isn\u0026rsquo;t my forte, but, helped organize a couple of events at Quark. Feels good. Effective Communication is less about how well you choose your words but more about your quantum of concern for the other person and the matter at hand!  Pilani Campus, Love at First sight. Never really felt like coming back.\n The arts/non-technical clubs there are simply superb! We have a lot to learn Cycling on campus. A dream come true! All Night Canteen is a real hangout place! Green, Greener, Greenest. Never really felt like we were in the deserts of Rajasthan. \u0026hellip;. the list can go on and on. I\u0026rsquo;ll stop here.  FOSS n me.\n Attended my first FOSS event! The Install Fest @ Quark. Wasn\u0026rsquo;t as awe inspiring as I would\u0026rsquo;ve liked it to be, but still a memorable one. Simply for being my first install-fest and for the lessons we learnt. FOSSKriti\u0026rsquo;08 is one event I\u0026rsquo;ll regret missing. It was absolutely amazing. I\u0026rsquo;m just hoping, people here too get to that level soon enough. Free Software and Freeware ain\u0026rsquo;t the same stuff. It\u0026rsquo;s extremely painful when people address FOSS stuff as freeware. Free Software is Software that\u0026rsquo;s Free as in Free Speech n Freeware is software that if free as in free beer. Eagerly awaiting mukt.in v2. Can\u0026rsquo;t wait to get back home! Enjoying my time on \\#mukt.in and \\#linux-india. The new DC hub (GNOME) for FOSS junta is cool too! There\u0026rsquo;s an urgent need to start contributing to FOSS. But how?  Haven\u0026rsquo;t yet found myself an intern/project for summer. Wonder what\u0026rsquo;s in store, this summer.\n Most of the gang\u0026rsquo;s On-Campus next sem. Will really miss Voodoo though. Hoping he has a rocking PS.\n Hoping we won\u0026rsquo;t have to shift hostels next sem.\n Appreciation is a great motivator. Expressing it promptly is important. I\u0026rsquo;m bad at it. Should work on it.\n \u0026ldquo;The gang\u0026rdquo; is like a flock of birds in flight.\n This semester is coming to an end already, and I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything I\u0026rsquo;d be proud of.\n Wonder why I have absolutely no feelings about the farewell we\u0026rsquo;d be having soon.\n Awaiting Ugadi Celebs. Seems like they are gonna rock more than ever.\n Gone are those days, when I used to post because something I had to write about, compelled me to do so. These days, the long inactivity on my blog is turning out to be the sole reason for my posts. [A few Rare Exceptions though, and this one isn\u0026rsquo;t] I wonder if its because life\u0026rsquo;s become uneventful or because I grew lazier or because of something else.\n I don\u0026rsquo;t like posting accounts of events from the recent/distant past, but I\u0026rsquo;m doing it just to prevent my blog\u0026rsquo;s death.\n  ",

Live-CD is the way to go! But then Emacs doesn\u0026rsquo;t \\*usually\\* go with Live-CDs. So I decided to get around making my own. :) [Dunnet \u0026ldquo;Dunnet Game\u0026rdquo;), an Adventure game in Emacs, played a crucial role in motivating me to go ahead!] The rest as they say is history\u0026hellip;.\nActually, I tried a debootstrap from my Debian etch but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t manage to get the initrd working. [[http://avudem.blogspot.com \u0026ldquo;Voodoo\u0026rdquo;][I ain\u0026rsquo;t this geekish, its only that I am incapable of putting these terms in a simpler language.] After numerous futile attempt, I gave up for the time being and that\u0026rsquo;s when the genius of [Voodoo]] came in, he took a different route. Remastering Knoppix.[Modifying an existing Live-CD of Knoppix]\nI won\u0026rsquo;t get into the exact details of how we got about it. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of online help available for that.\nA few highlights, for the curious reader\u0026hellip;\n got rid of the default KDE and replaced it with Fluxbox. [actually Floppix = Fluxbox + Knoppix :P] added emacs, cmucl, slime, octave, linuxdcpp, vlc and others. got rid of other packages which we weren\u0026rsquo;t going to use. changed the boot message changed the default background image. removed the default boot image [ couldn\u0026rsquo;t change it as the image we chose wasn\u0026rsquo;t being properly converted to lss16 format ] tested the CD with Qemu [size of the iso got more than 700MB] removed a few other not so regularly used packages [including wine!] burnt the CD Logged in!  Now, that I\u0026rsquo;ve logged in, I realize we managed to quite a decent job. Obviously we weren\u0026rsquo;t perfect. It was the first time and done in quite a hurry. [btw, we have our end-sems going on; I\u0026rsquo;ve no exam tomorrow though] I was able to listen to music, connect to the DC, play a game of dunnet and make a blogpost! We also missed a few packages, for instance a screen shot capture program! But it ain\u0026rsquo;t too bad, still a long way to go though!\nJust hoping we manage to make it better, as we get better at it! ;)\nHere comes FloppixV0.1!\nUpdate [3/1/08]: I never knew that GIMP could capture screenshots! ImageMagick can do that too. I had two programs at hand and thought I had none! Here\u0026rsquo;s a Screenshot of the Floppix Desktop.\n Picture Source [for the Background Image] : 9\nUpdate 2 [4/1/08]: There is already a floppy distro of Linux called Floppix.

I was shocked to hear of an experiment being done at the big accelerator at the National Accelerator Laboratory, where a person used deuterium. In order to compare his heavy hydrogen results to what might happen with light hydrogen, he had to use data from someone else\u0026rsquo;s experiment on light hydrogen, which was done on a different apparatus. When asked why, he said it was because he couldn\u0026rsquo;t get time on the program (because there\u0026rsquo;s so little time and it\u0026rsquo;s such expensive apparatus) to do the experiment with light hydrogen on this apparatus because there wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be any new result. And so the men in charge of programs at NAL are so anxious for new results, in order to get more money to keep the thing going for public relations purposes, they are destroying \u0026ndash; possibly \u0026ndash; the value of the experiments themselves, which is the whole purpose of the thing. It is often hard for the experimenters there to complete their work as their scientific integrity demands.\n When I first read this {from Feynman\u0026rsquo;s Cargo Cult Science [Adapted from a Caltech commencement address in 1974]}, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t quite figure out what or how exactly things are happening and what exactly Feynman meant by \u0026ldquo;losing the value of experiments\u0026rdquo;.

One would imagine, that I am here enjoying myself; that I am enjoying thoroughly the exposure I am getting to the world of Physics at a Research Level; that I am spending each moment, inspired. But things haven\u0026rsquo;t been so rosy here\u0026hellip; until today! [All this while I had been only doing a lot of mechanical labor, very unhappily\u0026hellip;]\nIts around 12 noon, when I get a call, in the lab, from my guide asking me to come down to room no. so and so. I had no idea what that room had, or why I had been called. I enter and I am lead to another room inside. I enter and there\u0026rsquo;s a huge machine. (first look, reminded me of Vickers\u0026rsquo; Hardness Testing Machine, that we had in Lab at coll and I had a test on using it!) and its called a TEM. But when I got closer, I fell in love with it! I dunno how and why, but it looked simply amazing and extremely lovely to me [Nothing like the Vickers\u0026rsquo; machine]. A 25 to 30 year old machine, lots of controls all over it, lots of circuitry out in the open\u0026hellip; absolutely awe-inspiring..[though I knew nothing about them.]\nAnd then came the moment. The lights in the room were turned off, and slowly and steadily the beam intensity of the TEM was increased. Gradually the Greenish Fluoroscent Screen (displaying a sample magnified X27,000) came to life\u0026hellip; with control lights blinking here and there\u0026hellip; in the darkness of the room.It was absolutely amazing; A great feeling. Though I was in there for a very short while\u0026hellip; an absolutely unforgettable experience; and will remain so, for the rest of my life.\nNow, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter to me even if I don\u0026rsquo;t learn much, during the training period, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind doing any kind-of mechanical work, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind not getting any results from my work, whatever\u0026hellip; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter any more.

Do we wish to have Engineers and Doctors who, all through the best couple of years of their lives, were busy grinding, swallowing and puking out heaps and heaps of books just to get one seat in a Grad School?\nWill things ever be normal again?

After failing to get a rank that would fetch me an Engg. course in any of the IITs, I landed here..\nThen the choice of discipline, that was just based on popular opinion and luck [called preferential allotment\u0026hellip;] and I finally ended up in EEE.\nBut the question is when did I make that choice of becoming a so-called Engineer? Did I ever consider the alternatives and make a decision? If yes, then when?? What kind of an engineer did I choose to become? Did I make the choice of becoming an electrical engineer??\nI think, I never knew what kind of an Engineer I wanted to be.[ with the knowledge of an average School pass out\u0026hellip;, you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect one to know all about the various fields of Engineering.] I think, I never even exactly knew [and don\u0026rsquo;t do so now\u0026hellip;], what it means to be an Engineer. An Electrical and Electronics Engineer.\nBut isn\u0026rsquo;t it important that we the future \u0026ldquo;Engineers\u0026rdquo; of the Country, know what it means to be one and what is expected of us? Isn\u0026rsquo;t that knowledge essential, for taking a decision to do engineering.. and also to make the most out of the Engineering programme?\nI wonder what field {or profession or whatever you call that\u0026hellip;} I would choose, if I were given a chance now\u0026hellip; [i.e after a couple of years in an Engineering College\u0026hellip;]\u0026hellip; I wonder which discipline I would choose after getting this little insight into the various fields in Engineering\u0026hellip; I wonder what I would choose, if I get this chance, a couple of years later\u0026hellip; or five years later\u0026hellip; :D\n Engineering is a great profession.

     "title": "Presentation or Tribulation??",
     "content": "This semester [2-2] I had to give two presentations! As if that was not enough trouble, the courses were (Principles of) Management [POM] and (Theory of) Relativity [ThoR] !! The former was with a group and the latter was an individual affair.. Each one had its Trials and Tribulations\u0026hellip; But at the end of each, I feel equally foolish. None of them were worth the efforts\u0026hellip;\nThe POM (a course whose reason for existence most of us fail to understand) presentation was specially torturous to our group. We had 8 members in our group, but to no avail. Nobody, other than Bubbly, was bothered about it until we were neck deep. With just 3 days left for the last day to submit the Report/Soft copy, our frantic searches began. We finally landed on an interesting topic, A Case Study on AMUL\u0026hellip; We started work only on the night before the submission day\u0026hellip; But the interest and excitement, [along with deadline.. :P] got us through with amazing speed. All of us, were through with our parts of the job before going to bed. The next morning, I along with 9 put together everything, almost ready to be submitted. But fate had other plans for us\u0026hellip; The topic we worked on was rejected! Reason:There\u0026rsquo;s already a group working on it!!\nBack to square one\u0026hellip; we began the search again. After much effort we found a couple of topics and approached her for approval. Though the topics weren\u0026rsquo;t damn interesting.. they were something we would\u0026rsquo;ve liked to work on. But all we get is another rejection and a Magazine that had a ready-made case study! We were supposed to speak on operations management[o.m] in a cosmetic multinational! [2 days, to work on some *#\u0026amp;$# cosmetic firm! Worasht!! Imagine writing a Report on a Presentation on a Report in a Journal\u0026hellip; and that too on a Cosmetic Company!!] The last nail on the coffin was hit. We felt hopeless and work didn\u0026rsquo;t start again till the night before the D-Day.. Not interested in working on that cosmetic thingy.. we decided to work on o.m in some other firm, and HLL seemed a neat choice.\nAfter slogging through the whole of the next morning, we somehow managed to get the report ready and finally at 2 pm, me and 9 went in search of a printer! None was found until 5:30 in the evening!! Somehow we submitted it finally\u0026hellip; Phew!\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s not the end of the story. There was a lot more in store for us. The presentation date. We were given a date, on which to give the presentation, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t give it on that day, for too many people were called and there was too little time\u0026hellip; Hats off to our Ma\u0026rsquo;am for such wonderful managerial skills. We had to beg her to allow us to present it on a date convenient to all of us.[She insisted that we do it on a particular date, when we already had other appointments!?!!] Finally, she agreed. Phew!\nOn the D-day, 8 people, 40 mins\u0026hellip; it was fun! There wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough time left for my turn and so I hurried through my part, the conclusion\u0026hellip;. But,the best part of it all was that, even a half-hearted, just-for-the-sake-of-it effort could impress her!! The presentation passsed off as a \u0026ldquo;very good presentation\u0026rdquo;! [Not \u0026ldquo;yaxcellent!\u0026rdquo;, though]\nThen the Relativity one! I had to speak on Kerr Black Holes. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t heard of them until one day Dr. A.K. Biswas gave me the topic, and asked me to speak on it, after he finishes teaching Schwarzchild Black Holes. It was all fine, until there was just a week left for the Compre\u0026rsquo;s to start and he didn\u0026rsquo;t start teaching about Black Holes!! This Monday he asked me when I was going to give my talk. Hoping that he would teach at least a small part of it during the last week, I chose Friday. [Even at the cost of ruining my comprees..] But, he didn\u0026rsquo;t even tell us what Black holes were, leave alone discussing the Schild Black Hole. I was trying my bit to work my way through it but 3 days were too few to read all about static Black Holes and then move on to Rotating ones! I had a tough time.. but tried my best to make head and tail of it. Finally today, I thought I understood a decent part of it and was ready to present it before the class.\nAfter an unsteady and slow start, I managed to put across a few points about Black Holes in general and the Kerr Geometry. But then, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t very comfortable with the other parts of what I had to present, and this clearly reflected in my talk. It was growing dumber and dumber\u0026hellip; So, Sir stopped and asked me if I was going to present the Penrose Diagram, and I said no. Thankfully he understood my situation and asked me what I wanted to present and asked me to finish it off with a few of the simpler things. I jabbered something and was done with it. Phew!\nBut what was the result of all this drama? Were the results in proportion to the efforts put in? Were the presentations really worth the effort? If the intention of these presentations was to increase the Knowledge base of the class, I think we achieved nothing. If we were supposed to enlighten the class, then we failed in a big big way. But if the intention was to increase our own knowledge base, I would say we succeeded in a very small way\u0026hellip; There definitely are much more efficient ways to increase our own knowledge base. So is there any other purpose for such talks??\nA final few things\u0026hellip; [I know you are wondering why I wrote this post. Such a long one. I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026hellip;.]\n It would\u0026rsquo;ve been better had the topic change been in ThoR and not in POM. I should have spoken on Black Holes in general and Schwarzchild Black Holes. Not Kerr Black Holes. The two people who guided us/me in the Presentations had contrasting opinion on the Internet! Our Ma\u0026rsquo;am considered the Internet to be a Devil [or some such thing] She doesn\u0026rsquo;t like the fact that people get info for their presentations from the net. [Why? we haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out yet] Journals are god-like for her!! Unlike her, our Dr.Biswas is quite respectful of this wonderful tool.. the Internet. None of these presentations were comparable [in terms of energy,excitement and fun we had!] to our last sem\u0026rsquo;s presentation, \u0026ldquo;Copyleft\u0026rdquo;. Is it because Copyleft wasn\u0026rsquo;t a course related topic?? :P Giving a Technical presentation is tough. Its even worse if you are speaking on topic that you are studying just for the sake of the presentation. The presentations were rated as good, even if I know they were no where close to what a Real Presentation should be like. POM \u0026ndash; bcos Ma\u0026rsquo;am thought we used the journal she gave us!! ThoR \u0026ndash; to encourage us to put in greater efforts.

When people have the chance to learn a whole lot of science and put it to practical use\u0026hellip; why isn\u0026rsquo;t it that they are excited about it? Why is it that people just endup mugging a few formulae just before exams and get over with it? Where\u0026rsquo;s the problem?

Is it that the child within us..

Why is the emphasis on marks and grades growing exponentially? Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we start working to cut this growth at its root? Is this sytem good enough to produce \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; engineers, doctors, lawyers, journos, CA\u0026rsquo;s, architects, designers, writers, artists etc etc..\nWhere have all the gurukuls of the ancient past and the Santiniketans of the recent past gone?

On my way back home\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\nIt was 3:30 am. After about half an hour\u0026rsquo;s struggle to put myself to sleep, I gave up. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it was the chill of the night, the stink of the urinals or the shared berth that I slept on, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep. I decided to get up and have a stroll around. After some random walks, I sat down at the TTE\u0026rsquo;s seat and waited and waited and waited\u0026hellip;.\nMy last journey home, at the end of second sem was also quite similar. I spent a lot of time at the TTE\u0026rsquo;s seat\u0026hellip;unable to sleep\u0026hellip; waiting, waiting and waiting.. but it was quite different\u0026hellip;. I was in the elite company of Hari (Hari Charan a.k.a Prongs\u0026hellip; his nick in CS)\nThat journey is still very fresh in my memory\u0026hellip; I spent most of it with him; The morning was busy and lively with DumbC\u0026rsquo;s n stuff like that. In the afternoon while the others were enjoying a good nap, we tried studying some C programming. [ he just loved programming and was excited about doing a lotta cool stuff during the summer] But the afternoon heat got the better of me and eventually i fell asleep\u0026hellip;{I think, I induced a bit of sleep to him too ;-) }\nThat night is a most unforgettable one\u0026hellip; after all our guys went to sleep, both of us decided to spend some time listening to songs and try to put ourselves to sleep. [ The songs of RDB aren\u0026rsquo;t lullabies by any measure! and the train was running too fast: we couldn\u0026rsquo;t hear clearly with just one earphone each, even if we were on the top berth]\nSo, we ended up discussing matters of common interest\u0026hellip; we chatted on topics ranging from Movies to Religion and Culture to Dan Brown [he told me the whole story of Deception point in his trademark style!] to Games and Programming. I spoke my heart out\u0026hellip; {and so did he; as he always did} [haven\u0026rsquo;t had any other discussion which comes close to it] After a couple of hours, we decided to get down and move around, to enjoy the cool breeze, to look at the villages and the fields going past\u0026hellip; We shared the seat of the TTE for about an hour [that was the only window where we could sit : all the others had ppl sleeping beside them] \u0026hellip; looking out of the window\u0026hellip; enjoying the breeze.. [and each other\u0026rsquo;s company : I thoroughly enjoyed his.. hope it was the same with him too] and waiting, waiting and waiting\u0026hellip;\nWe had already spent three nights waiting for him, but still didn\u0026rsquo;t lose hope. We hoped he would some how return or would be found safe somewhere under the sun. But that was not to be. He never returned\u0026hellip; and all that was ever found was his body : lifeless\u0026hellip; The rough seas had him their victim\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no more Hari Charan, ra!\u0026ldquo;.

Here\u0026rsquo;s the first post that can genuinely be called \u0026ldquo;mine\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;\nWith my last minute \u0026lsquo;C2S\u0026rsquo; plans [Co-operate to Survive\u0026hellip; does it ring any bells??] failing to work, the tests did their job,cleaned me up [both literally and metaphorically]. Though I didn\u0026rsquo;t learn much while preparing for the tests, the syllabus gave me a brain wave (surprised to find that my Brain is still ticking\u0026hellip;. after more than one year of Engg.) : Build my first Computer game!! [Don\u0026rsquo;t expect too much from it\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m a novice at programming and my game doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have a GUI as of now!]\nI had been doing a l\u0026rsquo;l bit of C programming off late but, I never learnt \u0026lsquo;file management\u0026rsquo; until the \u0026ldquo;Test-2\u0026rdquo; forced me to, and Viola! I embarked on a self assigned, \u0026ldquo;Project - Hangman\u0026rdquo;.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a peek at the game\u0026hellip; [after a lot of testing and debugging (the use of technical terms is just a matter of \u0026ldquo;phantee\u0026rdquo;)]\n\u0026ldquo;Phantee\u0026rdquo;- a typical hyderabadi term; has no literal english translation; refers to \u0026ldquo;concealing ignorance in style\u0026rdquo; ??\nThe basics were quite simple and were done in two hours\u0026hellip; but then began the real test! The program needed a lot of improvements to make it \u0026ldquo;Playable\u0026rdquo; but, the tests were less than a week away.\nI managed to find enough time even during the tests (it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter whether you spend a week, a day or just an hour mugging - you are bound to be cleaned up!), and finished most of the stuff within a week.\nThere were quite a few road blocks which I had to get around. Amongst other things, obtaining a \u0026lsquo;decent\u0026rsquo; database of words was one. Initially, I wrote another program for building up a dbase of your own. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t good enough\u0026hellip;. so, with some ideas from Arunodai, I successfully integrated a dbase of 14000 words [picked it from another version of hangman] with my own version. After one whole week of debugging and improving {with an annoying disturbance called \u0026lsquo;Test-2\u0026rsquo;}, now my game is quite \u0026lsquo;playable\u0026rsquo; (i.e it can be played by people other than me).\nSo you might say, \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rsquo;s the big-deal about writing a simple program of about hundred lines, that can randomly display words and check if you guess it right within seven turns?\u0026ldquo;. This l\u0026rsquo;ll project of mine may seem like a Pro\u0026rsquo;jest\u0026rsquo; to many! [writing a complex code, messing it up, debugging it for one whole week, etc just for the sake of creating a simple game, that can be played if you have a friend,a pen and a paper. Doing so muchfor a game, that already has \u0026lsquo;n\u0026rsquo; version, seems very foolish and a collosal waste of time and effort. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t it??] Obviously, that\u0026rsquo;s not a great achievement, its not something thats worth a mention in the Guiness Book of World Records or something. But it taught me a lot of stuff, stuff that you can\u0026rsquo;t learn from books,stuff that you can\u0026rsquo;t learn by mugging [I wonder if you can learn anything under the sun by \u0026ldquo;Mugging\u0026rdquo;], stuff that you can only learn by experience.I learnt a lot more of Computer Programming through this project, than I learnt through two, \u0026lsquo;3-point\u0026rsquo; courses!! {Of course, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have even dreamt of doing such a thing, if not for these two courses, that introduced me to programming and taught me the essentials}. Can\u0026rsquo;t such projects make the other courses a joy too?\nThis brings me to our recent TRW [Technical Report Writing] project. You might wonder what kind of projects could be given in this kind of a course. We were asked to write a report on \u0026lsquo;Waste Management\u0026rsquo; in our college, and to include some suggestions on the ways to improve it. Though this was an interesting job, with scope for some field activity and other such stuff, we [a group of six members] successfully turned the \u0026lsquo;project\u0026rsquo; into a Pro\u0026rsquo;jest\u0026rsquo;!! [that\u0026rsquo;s my personal view; the others in the group may disagree].But still, we learnt a lot on Report writing. A lot more than what we learnt by reading pages and pages of instructions, on the techniques of writing good reports,by the so called experts.\nBoth the projects helped me understand stuff better and to put them to use. Why can\u0026rsquo;t all courses have little projects, along with the routine stuff? Will it not improve my understanding of the subject matter? Will I not learn a great deal of things more than I do by mugging things up, just a week before the tests? Will it not be an experience, a lesson, of its own??\n I see and I forget. I hear and I remember. I do and I understand. \u0026ndash;A Chinese Proverb.\n I wonder if my \u0026ldquo;Engineering\u0026rdquo;, will ever be a joy for me?\nI am looking forward to more Projects\u0026hellip; to make engineering a joy for me!!

     "content": "  Date: Sun, 31 Aug 2003 23:45:42 -0500 From: \u0026quot;Harley D. Eades III\u0026quot; To: rms@gnu.org Subject: Tribute to freedom. Hello, One late rainy night I had an idea. There is a hill on IL route 29 in Peoria IL, that people climb and write a small message across this hill for everyone to view from a far. What would be better than spreading my two most favorite words across this hill. So we set out with a little over 200 garbage bags and nearly 400 nails. 12:30am and rainy so you can figure that a hill of that size is going to be slippery (lol) nearly falling down hill with every step we start building each letter. At around 2:30am we have finished and now the sun will rise over a hill which spreads the words Free Software to every person that passes by. This is by far a vary small non-complex hack but I beleve it is a hack in it self. This is a tribute to Free Software [and the GNU Project]. Happy Hacking Harley D. Eades III FSF Associate Member Hacker  ",

It is a simple client-side page with javascript that works offline too.\nStatiki Statiki leverages free and open services and software like GitHub, TravisCI and Nikola to provide a means of deploying static websites, without needing any setup on the users\u0026rsquo; machine.\nGetHub GetHub was made for the geeks whose primary Social Network is GitHub and who keep checking for updates, a dozen times every hour. :)\nThis extension was written when pop-up notifications were newly introduced into Chrome, and I was excited by it. I now prefer a workspace with fewer distractions, and no longer use this.\nNikola orgmode plugin Nikola supports multiple markup formats as input, orgmode being one of them. The support for this is added by this plugin, and this blog is generated using this plugin.\ncinspect cinspect attempts to extend Python\u0026rsquo;s built-in inspect module to add \u0026ldquo;inspection\u0026rdquo; for Python\u0026rsquo;s builtins and other objects not written in Python. It uses libclang to parse C-code and indexes it to allow looking up the source of the required objects, using an inspect-like API.\nThe original idea was from a friend, Tom Ballinger, who also helped me design and test it out.\nBlaggregator Recursers write awesome blog posts all over the internet, and blaggregator is a Django powered site that aggregates all these posts. (You will need an RC login to view it).\nThe project was originally thought of, and built by Sasha. I\u0026rsquo;ve added a bunch of features to it, and help with maintaining it.\nNikola Nikola is a static site and blog generator written in Python that can generate a blog from input in many different markup formats.\nThis website has been generated using Nikola. I use the development branch of Nikola and actively contribute to the development of features that I need or fix bugs that affect me.\norg2blog I no longer actively maintain org2blog since I don\u0026rsquo;t use any Wordpress blogs, anymore.

We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit. \u0026ndash; Albert Schweitzer, 1875 - 1965\n Anyone who cannot cope with mathematics is not fully human. At best he is a tolerable subhuman who has learned to wear shoes, bathe and not make messes in the house. \u0026ndash; Lazarus Long, Time Enough for Love\n You probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t worry about what people think of you if you could know how seldom they do. \u0026ndash; Olin Miller\n If you judge people, you have no time to love them. \u0026ndash; Mother Teresa\n Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. \u0026ndash; William Arthur Ward\n Where the mind is without fear and the head held high;\nWhere knowledge is free;\nWhere the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;\nWhere words come out from the depth of truth;\nWhere tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;\nWhere the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;\nWhere the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action;\nInto that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.\nRabindranath Tagore \u0026ndash; Let My Country Awake\n The true Enlightenment thinker, the true rationalist, never wants to talk anyone into anything. No, he does not even want to convince; all the time he is aware that he may be wrong. Above all, he values the intellectual independence of others too highly to want to convince them in important matters. He would much rather invite contradiction, preferably in the form of rational and disciplined criticism. He seeks not to convince but to arouse \u0026ndash; to challenge others to form free opinions. \u0026ndash; Karl Popper \u0026ndash; On Freedom\n Don\u0026rsquo;t ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes you come alive. And then go and do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. \u0026ndash; Howard Thurman\n All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt. \u0026ndash; Charles M Schultz\n Somewhere in the world someone is training when you are not. When you race him, he will win. \u0026ndash; Tom Fleming\n Because when something happens, she\u0026rsquo;s the person I want to tell. The most basic indicator of love. \u0026ndash; David Levithan\n If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you\u0026rsquo;ve launched too late. \u0026ndash; Reid Hoffman\n Nothing of me is original. I am the combined effort of everyone I\u0026rsquo;ve ever known. \u0026ndash; Chuck Palahniuk\n I fell in love with the way you sleep; slowly then all at once \u0026ndash; John Green\n The enjoyment of one\u0026rsquo;s tools is an essential ingredient of successful work. \u0026ndash; Donald E. Knuth\n Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that no longer serves you, grows you, or makes you happy. \u0026ndash; Robert Tew\n It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves. \u0026ndash; William Shakespeare\n I saw that my life was a vast glowing empty page and I could do anything I wanted. \u0026ndash; Jack Kerouac\n The truth is, everyone is going to hurt you. You just got to find the ones worth suffering for. \u0026ndash; Bob Marley\n Scientists study the world as it is; engineers create the world that has never been. \u0026ndash; Theodore von Karman\n If you can love someone with your whole heart, even one person, then there\u0026rsquo;s salvation in life. Even if you can’t get together with that person. \u0026ndash; Haruki Murakami\n The truth is rarely pure and never simple \u0026ndash; Oscar Wilde\n Memories warm you up from the inside. But they also tear you apart. \u0026ndash; Haruki Murakami\n We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. \u0026ndash; Aristotle\n Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in a long-shot. \u0026ndash; Charlie Chaplin\n Another flaw in the human character is that everyone wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance. \u0026ndash; Kurt Vonnegut\n In three words I can sum up everything I\u0026rsquo;ve learned about life: it goes on. \u0026ndash; Robert Frost\n Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. \u0026ndash; Brian Kernighan\n Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining. \u0026ndash; Anne Lamott\n Life is an awful, ugly place to not have a best friend. \u0026ndash; Sarah Dessen\n Warning: everything saved will be lost. \u0026ndash; Wii notification\n Happiness is nothing more than good health and a bad memory. \u0026ndash; Albert Schweitzer\n Silence is the language of god. All else is poor translation. \u0026ndash; Rumi\n To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket \u0026ndash; safe, dark, motionless, airless \u0026ndash; it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy, is damnation. The only place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell. \u0026ndash; C. S. Lewis\n Quality is the result of a million selfless acts of care \u0026ndash; not just of any great method that descends from the heavens. That these acts are simple doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that they are simplistic; and it hardly means that they are easy. They are nonetheless the fabric of greatness and, more so, of beauty in any human endeavor. To ignore them is not yet to be fully human. \u0026ndash; James O. Coplien, Foreword to Clean Code\n We are all in the same boat, in a stormy sea, and we owe each other a terrible loyalty. \u0026ndash; G.K. Chesterton\n The road to wisdom? \u0026ndash; Well, it\u0026rsquo;s plain and simple to express:\nErr\nand err\nand err again\nbut less\nand less\nand less.\n\u0026ndash; Piet Hein (Grooks)\n My idea of dominating is that I get all of the players on my team to play better than if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t there. \u0026ndash; Ben Wiggins\n It is a risk to love. What if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work out? Ah, but what if it does. \u0026ndash; Peter McWilliams\n Wherever you go, go with all your heart \u0026ndash; Confucius\n Satisfaction of one\u0026rsquo;s curiosity is one of the greatest sources of happiness in life. \u0026ndash; Linus Pauling\n I wanted to change the world. But I have found that the only thing one can be sure of changing is oneself. \u0026ndash; Aldous Huxley\n The true voyage of discovery consists not of going to new places, but of having a new pair of eyes. \u0026ndash; Marcel Proust (1871–1922)\n All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. \u0026ndash; Edmund Burke\n I think that it\u0026rsquo;s extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don\u0026rsquo;t think we are. I think we\u0026rsquo;re responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don\u0026rsquo;t become missionaries. Don\u0026rsquo;t feel as if you\u0026rsquo;re Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about computing other people will learn. Don\u0026rsquo;t feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What\u0026rsquo;s in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more. \u0026ndash; Alan J. Perlis (April 1, 1922-February 7, 1990)\n Forgetting is like radiation: you cannot smell it, you cannot taste it, and when you finally notice the damage, it is already irreversible \u0026ndash; Piotr Wozniack\n Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes \u0026ndash; Edsger Dijkstra\n Do anything, but let it produce joy. \u0026ndash; Walt Whitman\n Learn to value yourself, which means: fight for your happiness \u0026ndash; Ayn Rand\n If you don\u0026rsquo;t stand for something you will fall for anything \u0026ndash; Malcolm X\n Do you want to know who you are? Don\u0026rsquo;t ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you \u0026ndash; Thomas Jefferson\n We will be held accountable for all the permitted pleasures we failed to enjoy. \u0026ndash; Talmud Yerwshalmi\n It\u0026rsquo;s so easy to hate. It takes strength to be gentle and kind. \u0026ndash; The Smiths\n To be trusted is a greater compliment than being loved \u0026ndash; George MacDonald\n I am more convinced than ever. Conceptual integrity is central to product quality. \u0026ndash; Fred Brooks\n If the software doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to work, you can always meet any other requirement. \u0026ndash; Gerald Weinberg\n Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn\u0026rsquo;t do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. \u0026ndash; Mark Twain\n Be careful when you fight the monsters, lest you become one. \u0026ndash; Friedrich Nietzsche\n Assume nobody else has any idea what they\u0026rsquo;re doing either. A lot of people refuse to try something because they feel they don\u0026rsquo;t know enough about it or they assume other people must have already tried everything they could have thought of. Well, few people really have any idea how to do things right and even fewer are to try new things, so usually if you give your best shot at something you\u0026rsquo;ll do pretty well. \u0026ndash; Aaron Swartz\n What makes this advice especially hollow and pious is that I am not dead yet. If it were any good, I could easily take it myself. \u0026ndash; Kurt Vonnegut, in a letter to his daughter Nanny\n Go out and walk. That is the glory of life. \u0026ndash; Artist Maira Kalman\n I think it\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool that there are tutorials to do things that are pretty near the state of the art. \u0026ndash; Dan L. on tutorials in Theano for doing Deep Learning stuff\n All things worth doing are frustrating. How much satisfaction do you get from doing something easy? \u0026ndash; Joe Armstrong on Twitter\n Be happy with what you have. Be excited about what you want. \u0026ndash; Alan Cohen\n If you love something, be prepared to lose it. \u0026ndash; Haruki Murakami in a Tweet\n Let death be what takes us, not lack of imagination \u0026ndash; BJ Miller in a TED talk\n One doesn\u0026rsquo;t discover new lands without consenting to lose sight, for a very long time, of the shore. \u0026ndash; André Gide in Les faux-monnayeurs [The Counterfeiters]\n A good life is not a life without problems. A good life is a life with good problems. \u0026ndash; Mark Manson in a blog post\n HEY, FRIENDS. PLEASE BOTHER ME. \u0026ndash; Kara M on Zulip on \u0026ldquo;What really matters\u0026rdquo;.\n Joy is the best makeup \u0026ndash; Anne Lamott\n I am rarely happier than when spending an entire day programming my computer to perform automatically a task that would otherwise take me a good ten seconds to do by hand \u0026ndash; Douglas Adams in Last Chance to See.\n Don\u0026rsquo;t wait for a light to appear at the end of the tunnel, stride down there and light the bloody thing yourself. \u0026ndash; Sara Henderson in From Strength to Strength\n It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter where you are, you are nowhere compared to where you can go. \u0026ndash; Bob Proctor\n Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives. \u0026ndash; William A. Foster\n How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives \u0026ndash; Annie Dillard\n The truth is, most of us discover where we are headed when we arrive. \u0026ndash; Bill Watterson\n The people you love aren\u0026rsquo;t interruptions, they’re the reason you work at all. Give \u0026lsquo;em a hug. \u0026ndash; Jason Zimdars in this post\n Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity. \u0026ndash; Simone Weil\n Ten years from now, make sure you can say that you chose your life, you didn’t settle for it. \u0026ndash; Mandy Hale, The Single Woman\n   ",
