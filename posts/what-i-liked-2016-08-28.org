I liked [[http://smo.nu/how-to-have-healthy-relationships-as-a-developer/][this article]] advising developers on having healthy relationships.  Most
of it is common sense stuff -- "Whether it be a side project or main project,
understand that sacrificing relationships isn't worth it."

I really enjoyed [[http://theladiesfinger.com/autorickshaw-rides/][this article]] by Priyanka on how she started talking to Auto
Drivers.  She shares a bunch of stories of drivers she talked to, that makes me
wonder how many more such stories just go unheard, because I don't talk.

@scopatz wrote up a [[https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/413#issuecomment-243598510][nice argument]] explaining why @github should add back BSD to
the list of licenses shown on the site.  It taught me a thing or two about BSD
and MIT.

I enjoyed spending the weekend at [[https://twitter.com/_mavin][@_mavin]]'s place, discussing continuous
improvement in life, among other things.  Also, had a lot of fun playing
[[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.ellen.psych&hl=en][Psyche]].  The game is so addictive, but the app is not all that great.  Someone
should make a more robust app for this, or something that piggybacks on an
existing network service like Telegram or Facebook chat or Google hangouts.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erywPdFfORE][Falling In Love At A Coffee Shop by Landon Pigg]] is a lovely song, that I
discovered this week.
