I really enjoyed reading the [[http://muse-amuse.in/~punchagan/317574828-Perumal-Judgment.pdf][full judgement]] given by the Madras High Court in
the Perumal Murugan case.  The court said something [[http://scroll.in/article/811211/the-right-to-write-key-bits-from-the-judgment-that-brings-author-perumal-murugan-back-from-the-dead][on the lines of]]: not all
art may be for everyone, and if you don't like a book, throw it away.  The
judgement also made it clear that it is the responsibility of the state to
ensure that things don't go haywire using appropriate measures, and banning
things left, right and center is not the way to deal with it.

[[http://imgur.com/a/YkDVQ][This letter]] that a Law professor wrote in response to a student's complaint
about him wearing a Black Lives Matter t-shirt is superb!

Gabriel Weinberg's [[https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d#.jb26ylhgg][post]] with a list of mental models that he found repeatedly
useful has been great.  There have also been some great comments on it!  I wish
to keep going back to the post.

[[https://twitter.com/anaghs][Anaghs]] shared a summary of Brian Christain's [[https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/solving-hard-decisions-1dabb1dbd14b#.urdva9rit][Algorithms to Live By]] and the
books seems really interesting.  Added it to my reading list.

This [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrAuc3-EI54][ad]] by BigBazaar for Eid touched a chord.

Black Mirror's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entire_History_of_You][The Entire History of You]] totally got to my head, and if you are
interested in the future of technology and human behavior, I highly recommend
watching this episode, if not all the episodes.  Thanks to [[https://twitter.com/cloud9trt][@9]] for the
recommendation.

[[http://thekindlyone.pythonanywhere.com/][Calvin and Hobbes' Search]] is a fun project - search for Christmas, Life and
Universe and enjoy the wisdom!

Sowmya Rajendran's post on how the [[http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/magic-menstrual-cup-how-it-made-my-period-freaking-easy-44827][menstrual cup]] touched her life more than
anything else after the Internet, was an interesting read.

The lights in the audience truly look "amazingly beautiful" in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qci3dMut-g0][this Coldplay
video]].

I'll try and post things that made me happy or touched my heart, each week.
