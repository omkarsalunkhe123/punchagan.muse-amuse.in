I gave a short talk titled, /Pictures, Songs and Python/ in this
year's edition of SciPy India.  The talk was a beginner level
talk, mainly intended to get newbies excited about Python.  My
motive was to impress upon the audience that Python is a language
to help you think in. It's a good playing ground to experiment
with your ideas, quickly prototype ideas and have fun!  To my
surprise, the talk was liked by quite a few people.  Thanks to
Prof. Jayant Kirtane for the Bournville!
