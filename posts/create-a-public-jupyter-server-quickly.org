I create public Jupyter notebooks once in a while, to collaborate with a
friend, or to make it easier for myself to work on a remote machine, where I
have to interact with images, etc.

Each time, there are a couple of steps that I need to take, set a password in
the configuration, and create certificate files for https.

I just wrote a bash script that does the following, quickly -

- Create a new virtualenv
- Install Jupyter
- Set a password
- Create certificate files
- Start the server
- Delete all temporary files, when the server is shutdown
