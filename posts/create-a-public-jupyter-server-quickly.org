I create public Jupyter notebooks once in a while, to collaborate with a
friend, or to make it easier for myself to work with data on a remote machine.

Each time I need to look up the [[http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html][docs]], and manually set-up a few things, before
I can start using the notebook.

I just wrote a bash script that does the following, quickly -

- Install Jupyter into a temporary virtualenv
- Create certificate files
- Start the server with https enabled and a password
- Delete all temporary files, when the server is shutdown

You can get it [[https://github.com/punchagan/dot-files/blob/master/bin/jupyter-server.sh][here]], if you'd like to use it.
