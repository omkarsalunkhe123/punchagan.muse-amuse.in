I first heard of this book in a discussion on relationships amongst friends
from RC.  The discussion was quite interesting and the book received more than
a couple of strong recommendations. So, I decided to pick it up.

Very simply, the book is codified common sense explaining what Love is. Gary
Chapman, the author, started with the question "What makes you feel loved" and
found that the answers could be grouped into the following 5 categories:

1. Words of affirmation
2. Quality time
3. Receiving gifts
4. Acts of service
5. Physical touch,

which he calls the languages of love.  He also proposes that people have a
*primary* language of love, and a failure to speak to a person in their primary
language would make them feel unloved.

The book is filled with anecdotes to explain what each of these languages means
and how to speak them, along with practical advice and exercises to learn to
speak each of these languages.  Though the book has been written with couples
in mind, the fundamental ideas in this book can be applied to any
relationships. I feel like it has been helping me connect a few dots, ever
since I've started reading it.

It has been totally worth my time to read this book. A highly recommended read!

Below are some of my notes. Feel free to suggest improvements (for readability
and otherwise) on the notes.
