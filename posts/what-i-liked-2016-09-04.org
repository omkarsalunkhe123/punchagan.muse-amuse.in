This week was a busy one, and I didn't really consume too much web content.

A colleague mentioned that he was reading the book -- [[https://www.amazon.com/Millennial-Project-Colonizing-Galaxy-Eight/dp/0316771651/][The Millennial Project: Colonizing
the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps]]  and it seemed to have some interesting ideas
that I've never come across before.

The [[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=berklee+indian+ensemble][Berklee Indian Ensemble]] performed at the [[http://www.bgu.co.in/][Bengaluru Ganesh Utsava]] and I went
along with [[https://twitter.com/Sunil_santiago][Sunil]] to their performance, which we thoroughly loved.

I liked some of [[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=chet+baker+instrumental][Chet Baker instrumentals]] that I listened to this week.
