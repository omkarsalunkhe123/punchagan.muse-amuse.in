[[http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/cool-data-visualisation-reveals-extent-of-global-warming-28723][Great visualizations]] about how global temperatures have been changing in the
last ~165 years.  If you are still a global warming skeptic, you definitely
must see them.

[[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/09/sports/olympics/2016-08-09-olympics-phelps-vs-phelps.html][These visualizations]] of Michael Phelps' performances at Olympics over the years
by NYTimes are great, too!

I came across these delightful videos ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XatrFO1N0gY][1]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQtuJnS5lPQ][2]]) of girls and boys playing cricket
at Haji Public School.  Look ma, no sexism in [[http://theladiesfinger.com/tata-salt-ad-babita-kumari/][coverage of sports]].

This (Telugu) interview of Dr Jayaprakash Narayan is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKF_HqEXLZI][truly inspiring]].  Also,
YouTube recommended his [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyr31JYwftI][conversation with Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev]], which was
unexpectedly insightful, and covers a wide variety of topics -- spirituality,
religion, social organizations, politics, socialism vs. capitalism.
