[[https://twitter.com/cloud9trt][@9]] shared this story about [[http://www.filmsforaction.org/articles/the-white-man-in-that-photo/][Peter Norman]]. Woah, so inspirational!

[[http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/zo1459rOwDTjYN9Wr1ZJqJ/Amitav-Ghosh-We-are-living-our-lives-as-though-we-are-mad.html][This conversation]] with Amitav Ghosh on his latest book The Great Derangement is
pretty scary!  He says, "You know that this great derangement is ultimately
going to lead to a great unraveling, but to see it working itself out, day
after day, in the news, it's so terrifying. I mean, it's here, it's
happening. You may not see it a direct connection between the events happening
in the world today and the climate in general, but that relationship does
exist. In Syria, everything started with a great drought. The Middle East, this
entire Mediterranean region, is going through a historic drought. And if you
think about how this tumult in the Arab world began, it was with protests over
food in Tunisia. So what we're facing really, if you like, is a catastrophic
convergence of natural impacts and human impacts."  I ended up buying the book
at [[https://www.facebook.com/The-Bookworm-152526681474551/][Bookworm]].

[[http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/how-reservations-help-disadvantaged-caste-students-get-higher-education-88852][This IndiaSpend article]] on how Quota's have helped the disadvantaged caste
students is a really well written article, with informative charts.

Kenneth Reitz released Episode-2 of [[https://soundcloud.com/import-this][Import This]], a podcast that I wasn't aware
of and ended up listening to [[https://soundcloud.com/import-this/episode-1][Episode-1]]. I really liked the discussion on being
considerate to others in communities that you are part of.  The quote that this
episode ends with, "Software is all about the people. Don't dismiss them. Don't
dismiss their experience.", resonated well with me.

Julia Evans' [[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnpetubXYAA-cFx.jpg][how to be a wizard programmer]] sketch is rad! ([[https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/755020037979856896/photo/1][tweet]]).

I watched the movie [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0878804/][Blind Side]] (2009) with friends, and really liked it. SJ and
Oher together, they are a blast!
