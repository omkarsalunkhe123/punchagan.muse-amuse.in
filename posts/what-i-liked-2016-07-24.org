This week was relatively quiet for me.  But, here's what I liked, mostly from
my twitter timeline.  If you follow me on twitter, there may not be anything
new for you.

This [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy088gyClIc][short video]] on how Nima made it to Ultimate's most prestigious tournament
made me cry each time I watched it.  And movies/videos rarely make me cry.

Sacha Chua [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2016/03/microphthalmia-small-eye/][writes]] about her baby's Microphthalmia and says this -- "She'll make
an awesome pirate. Or cyborg. Or cyborg pirate. If she wants."  Woah!

I discovered [[https://soundcloud.com/krishashok/rains-of-castamere][Rains Of Castamere by Krish Ashok]] and loved it. Some looping
happened!

@varungrover wrote [[https://twitter.com/varungrover/status/759034413040607232/photo/1][argued]] for using better insults than 'Presstitue' and I
agree. I have had similar thoughts on the other insults he talks about.

[[https://twitter.com/aishu_s/status/759062643361533952][This tweet thread]] got me thinking about speaking up, and standing up, and how
people fail to do it, and what could help prevent these failures.
