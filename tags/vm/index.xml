      <description> Amber talked about &amp;ldquo;exploring only until the current task is done&amp;rdquo; and moving on, which is could really be a lost opportunity to learn something new and gain a better understanding of the system I am working with. Having something (anything not directly related to the current project I&amp;rsquo;m working on) scheduled for later in the day, doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to do me much good. I feel distracted for quite a long period before the scheduled time. Abstractions and layers were talked about in the second exercise on Applicatives&amp;hellip; Layering, FTW! I spent about an hour or so in the afternoon reading the paper, One VM to rule them all. It talked about Truffle: an API to implement an AST parser for any language and Graal: a JIT compiler for the ASTs. Later in the day, I also went to the Papers we love meetup. The presentation and the talks were quite interesting! I also started looking at Elm and playing with it.  </description>
