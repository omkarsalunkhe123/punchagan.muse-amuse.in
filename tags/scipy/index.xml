      <description>PyCon is back to Bangalore for the 4th edition. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to all the previous three editions, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to this one.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t spoken at any of the previous editions, and hadn&amp;rsquo;t even really considered speaking at the previous editions. But, this time, I proposed a couple of talks, and both of them have been accepted! Woot! Lots of work ahead of me, but I&amp;rsquo;m really looking forward to give good talks. I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about Enaml, and showing a brief demo of all the wonderful things it makes possible. In the other talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll give a brief overview of the latest happenings in the SciPy community and the projects to look forward to and contribute to. Pankaj and I will be talking together on this.
Also, Kenneth (lawgon) will be deeply missed at this edition of PyCon.
Sadly, John Hunter, the lead author of matplotlib, also passed away last week. RIP. :(</description>

      <title>My talk at SciPy.in 2010</title>

      <description>I gave a short talk titled, Pictures, Songs and Python in this year&amp;rsquo;s edition of SciPy India. The talk was a beginner level talk, mainly intended to get newbies excited about Python. My motive was to impress upon the audience that Python is a language to help you think in. It&amp;rsquo;s a good playing ground to experiment with your ideas, quickly prototype ideas and have fun! To my surprise, the talk was liked by quite a few people. Thanks to Prof. Jayant Kirtane for the Bournville!
Here are the talk slides</description>

      <title>talk at GNUnify&#39; 10</title>

      <description>Shantanu and I conducted a workshop on Scipy at GNUnify &amp;lsquo;10. It was intended to be an introduction to Scipy and Numpy through Image processing. We expected an audience which was python literate. But GNUnify&amp;rsquo;s schedule wasn&amp;rsquo;t too favorable for us. Ours was the first talk scheduled and we ended up getting people who only &amp;ldquo;heard&amp;rdquo; of Python, the language.
We had planned quite a bit of stuff expecting a python literate audience. But unfortunately, we had to start almost from scratch and couldn&amp;rsquo;t do all of what we planned. Still, the workshop wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad. Nobody left mid-way during the 2 hour workshop; nobody was dozing either. I would have liked my first talk at a FOSS event to be better, though.
Slides and Images that we used. Shantanu&amp;rsquo;s post on the talk is here.</description>
