      <description> I happily let myself get distracted from all the math! I had seen a tweet by Tom during the weekend, asking if there was any package that let users inspect C sources of builtin modules like ruby&amp;rsquo;s pry-doc I spent the morning playing around with pry-doc, reading its code, etc. The latter part of the day was spent pairing with Tom, and figuring out what needs to be done to write a first cut version of something like this. Ugly regexes, FTW! I have something that works for most of the stuff, it seems! I also attended an interesting talk about Bit-torrent clients by an alum.  </description>
