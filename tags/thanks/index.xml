      <description>I just wanted to thank Sacha Chua for bearing with my newbie elisp code and trying out org2blog.
Also, thanks for the two patches she sent.
 Feature addition - Posting sub-trees instead of whole buffers. I had this feature in mind, and had started working on it after her request, but she was too quick for me! ;) Cleaning up of the code that uploads images.  I&amp;rsquo;m loving it!</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a post already with &amp;lsquo;exactly&amp;rsquo; this name&amp;hellip;. by 9&amp;hellip; here&amp;hellip; But this post doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much to do with his post&amp;hellip; [or may be it does??]
Here&amp;rsquo;s a Quote on Mahatma Gandhi&amp;hellip; /Generations to come, it may be, will scarcely believe that such a one, as this, ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth. &amp;ndash; Albert Einstein/
I was just wondering&amp;hellip;. what would happen if the name Albert Einstein was replaced by punchagan&amp;hellip; and it turned out that.. there&amp;rsquo;s a huge huge list of candidates for replacing Mahatma Gandhi&amp;hellip; [This is with due respect to the Mahatma and Einstein.. I don&amp;rsquo;t, in any sense, intend to say that the Mahatma was not a Mahatma&amp;hellip;]
All I want to say is&amp;hellip; I am seeing a whole lot of new things, in people around me, that inspire awe and respect in me&amp;hellip; that every person is unique&amp;hellip; every person is special.. every person can teach you something&amp;hellip;. there&amp;rsquo;s something to learn from everyperson&amp;hellip; that makes me believe God,truly, created man in his own image&amp;hellip;
I am grateful to all the people around me (and those not around any more..)&amp;hellip; who have shown, are showing, and will be showing me things bright and beautiful&amp;hellip; wise and wonderful&amp;hellip; which otherwise I would have failed to see..
I am grateful&amp;hellip; for getting me back on track.. when i go directionless,.. for setting me examples to emulate,&amp;hellip; for being with me whenever i needed and will need you&amp;hellip;
[ I would&amp;rsquo;ve loved to write down each and every name here&amp;hellip;. but that&amp;rsquo;s too big a job for this little being to achieve&amp;hellip; ]
As William Arthur Ward says&amp;hellip;.
 Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it.
 To All Jaani&amp;rsquo;s of the World&amp;hellip; Thanks a Lot&amp;hellip; (I know that&amp;rsquo;s too small a word&amp;hellip; but that&amp;rsquo;s all I can give right now&amp;hellip;)
&amp;ldquo;God created man in His own image&amp;hellip;. ﻿ God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good.&amp;rdquo; Gen 1:27, 31
“A friend is one with whom you are comfortable, to whom you are loyal, through whom you are blessed, and for whom you are grateful.” &amp;ndash; William Arthur Ward
In everyone&amp;rsquo;s life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit. &amp;ndash; Albert Schweitzer
Sometimes it not the wealth you have but what&amp;rsquo;s inside you that others need. &amp;ndash; Anonymous</description>

      <title>Happy gNew Year!!</title>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m a bit late&amp;hellip;(courtesy:lightning quick network speeds @coll&amp;hellip;{I started this post a couple of weeks back, at home&amp;hellip; and its been rotting all this while, in my drafts!} ) [Its already time when the resolutions taken just a couple of weeks back fade away into oblivion&amp;hellip; ] but anyways.. Wish You a Very Happy gNew Year!! oops.. Happy New Year!
Actually this year started of for me not as the usual Happy New Year.. but as Happy gNew Year! I have been gifted a new PC by my mom n dad for the new year&amp;hellip; and that too an AMD system, (Believe it or Not..) preloaded with Linux Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4]! {Its like a fairy tale for me&amp;hellip;} Its an AMD Athlon 3200+ with (512+256)MB RAM and 80GBHDD&amp;hellip;. and an awesome 17&amp;rdquo; TFT Monitor!!
I am happy that my resolutions to have a go at the comp&amp;hellip; [ and use it to the best of my abilities to learn about s/w and h/w&amp;hellip;. to try n imbibe in myself the spirit of true hacking&amp;hellip;] haven&amp;rsquo;t yet gone down the drain! { I&amp;rsquo;ve already ripped open the HCL company seal on my box&amp;hellip; and opened it up a couple of times to fiddle with my HDD and RAM&amp;hellip; }
A couple of days after I got the comp&amp;hellip; I tried installing Debian&amp;hellip; and being a NooB doesn&amp;rsquo;t help..(does it?).. I messed up the X-Server&amp;hellip; After some desperate attempts to get the thing working.. I gave up&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;. [I had some ebooks etc. downloaded on my comp at home, which I wished to dump on my comp]. So I persisted&amp;hellip; I tried FC 6 [Fedora Core] &amp;hellip;. everything was fine until the final step&amp;hellip; FC refused to show me the Login screen!! Finally at 3 am I gave up&amp;hellip;. I planned to get the most valuable stuff onto a CD and set things right, back in the comforts of my room and the company of Voodoo, but that was not to be&amp;hellip;.
At 10am, (I just woke up then), I find that the comp at home refuses to turn ON!! I thought it was some petty problem like a loose contact somewhere, which could be set right easily.. but after an hour of struggle.. I realise that the problem is serious.. {The SMPS had blown off} [looks like a Hindi Movie,doesn&amp;rsquo;t it??]
Then began the real fun!! I somehow managed to connect the old hard disk to the new Mother Board&amp;hellip;[my new cabinet is quite small&amp;hellip; I now realize that I placed the HDD in quite a precarious position&amp;hellip;].. but there was no OS on either HDD&amp;hellip; [the &amp;ldquo;Windows&amp;rdquo; on the old one&amp;hellip;. din&amp;rsquo;t open&amp;hellip; they felt awkward in their new environs&amp;hellip; ;-) ] I would have returned back to coll without any of my stuff.. but for Knoppix (live) &amp;hellip; it saved the day for me!! Finally I managed to dump my stuff onto the new HDD&amp;hellip; [All &amp;rsquo;s well that ends well!! :-)] Now I&amp;rsquo;ve got both the Linux distro&amp;rsquo;s [Debian and FC-6] along with all the stuff I collected at home! [ Thanks to V00d00!! ] along with a little confidence that I am not too bad at handling H/W!
When I look back at this whole episode&amp;hellip; It feels as if nature had conspired&amp;hellip;. to keep this one resolution of mine ALIVE&amp;hellip;. to ignite in me the fire of &amp;ldquo;the spirit of true hacking&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; [ I hope that I play my part well.. (nature played its brilliantly&amp;hellip;) and pick up a zillionth part of the commitment ( and dedication to hacking) of the Hackers from the Hacker Land!! ]
Here&amp;rsquo;s a pic of one of the very few cool things I could get my comp to do&amp;hellip;.. [ I accessed the Remote Desktop Server on my own system&amp;hellip;..]
 The Hacker Ethic : Access to computers and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative! &amp;ndash; Steven Levy&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Hackers : The Heroes of The Computer Revolution&amp;rdquo;</description>
