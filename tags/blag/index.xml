What was the most challenging part of the ride? You keep saying it was cold, how cold was it really? Did you meet any interesting people en-route? Would you do this again? If yes, which part of the year would you do it? If not, what other routes would you try? Do you have any pictures that you can share?  So, you cycled from Manali to Leh? Well, Not really. We cycled from Kalath to Whiskey Nala &amp;ndash; a distance of 280km &amp;ndash; which is about 60% of the Manali-Leh route.
Who is &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo;? Vivek and I were on the bikes. Shabu was our guide helping us fix our bikes and fixing up our meals, but more than anything else, ensuring that we don&amp;rsquo;t freeze to death. Susheel was driving along and cheering us.
How did you decide to do this? Vivek and I were going to Coorg with Prats and Addy, and Prats told us a whole lot of stories of her adventures in the mountains. Not sure how bicycles came into the picture, but as soon as they did, both of us got really excited about it. This was on some sort of a bucket list for me, ever since I read Vatsap&amp;rsquo;s cycling story many years ago. Soon, after we were back in town, the ball was set rolling&amp;hellip;
What is the maximum elevation you cycled to? We started off at around 1.8km and went up to about 5km in a span of 5 days. We also spent a day in Manali, getting our cycles fixed and acclimatizing. You can see the elevation profile here.
How long did the whole ride take? Our plan was to finish the whole distance in 7 days. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t get to our designated camp on the 5th day, and had to use the support car to get to camp before it got dark. We decided to end the ride once we took our bikes off the road.
Was it really hard? Why couldn&amp;rsquo;t you finish the ride? We expected the primary challenges to be:
 the altitude and lack of oxygen the fatigue from riding day after day after day&amp;hellip;  But, cold played a much bigger role than we thought it would. As we got higher and higher, it got so cold that we spent a significant amount of energy and brain cycles on trying to fight the cold, rather than enjoying the views or pushing ourselves to keep going despite the non-cold-related discomfort.
So, you do really need a support vehicle? Not really, if you were riding in better weather or were better prepared. The Manali to Leh route usually has a lot of temporary shops setup during the season, where you could crash, if it was too cold to just crash in your tent. Since, we were going after the season had almost ended, many of these shops were no longer open, and having the support car turned out to be quite useful on the last day.
How much did the support vehicle cost you? It turned out to be quite an expense for something we originally didn&amp;rsquo;t have in mind. We spent about 20k on the vehicle, fuel and the driver&amp;rsquo;s fee. We also paid our guide + cook + bicycle expert, separately.
Did you carry your own bikes? Yes.
 Flew from Bengaluru to Delhi Took a bus from Delhi to Manali Carried the bikes on the support car from Whiskey Nala to Leh Flew back from Leh to Delhi  Did the flights charge you for the bikes? The carrier (IndiGo) from BLR to DEL charged us a handling fees of Rs. 1000. The carrier (Vistara) on the return journey didn&amp;rsquo;t.
Would you recommend me to carry my bike? You could find bikes on rent, both in Manali and Leh, for about 500 to 700 per day. It would cost about 5-7k, based on how you plan your ride, to rent a bike. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to make arrangements to get the bike returned back to the place you rent it from &amp;ndash; this can get a little tricky.
If you already own a bike, and can it packed in a proper box, I would highly recommend that. The derailleurs, the shifters, and other such moving parts need to be well packed and guarded. Use a box or a cycling bag to put it in. Get professional help from a cycle retailer nearby, if required. This is one thing you cannot take any chances on, or your whole trip may be jeopardized!
We hadn&amp;rsquo;t paid enough attention to packing our bikes, and one of our bikes took quite some beating on the way to Delhi. On the way back, we managed to get the bike packed in a box and it was a breeze.
What cycle spares/tools did you carry? We were sort of ill prepared in this department. We only had the following:
 Hand pump Puncture kit Spare tubes (2 nos.) Allen key set  Based on advice from Shabu, I think you should also take these things:
 Brake cables Gear cables Spare tyre (1 Nos.) Brake shoes/pads Few spokes Chain oil  What sort of preparation did you do for this ride? We did a handful of 50-100km rides on weekends before this one. The only real elevation training/trial that we did was the Kalhatti climb, one weekend before this ride. This turned out to be pretty useful, and we found all the other climbs during this ride much less steeper than some of the Kalhatti ones.
Can you share your ride plan? What we actually rode    Day Start End Distance Elevation gain Comments     0 Kalath - -  Fix cycles and acclimatize   1 Kalath Marhi 45km 1675m Prepare to cross Rohtang!   2 Marhi Keylong 80km -210m Crossed Rohtang (3970m)   3 Keylong Patseo 48km +644m Easy ride; Deepak Tal!   4 Patseo Sarchu 64km +522m Crossed Baralachala(4902m)!   5 Sarchu Whiskey Nala 48km +465m Gata loops &amp;amp; Nakeela(4924m)    Original plan    Day Start End Distance Elevation gain Comments     5 Sarchu Pang 73km +225m Gata-loops, Nakeela(4924m) &amp;amp; Lachung La(5065m)   6 Pang Lato 103km -530m Moore Plains, Tanglang La (5328m)   7 Lato Leh 70km -600m Lots of downhill!    What was a typical day during the trip, like?  Wake up between 7 and 8, depending on when you can see/feel the warm sun. Laze in bed if you woke up too early, and the sun hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet warmed the place up. Eat porridge, and a few slices of bread with peanut butter. Pack ourselves up in as many layers of clothing as we can, while still being able to pedal. Check the bikes for any loose/fallen-off/broken parts, blow, etc. Start pedaling away - usually between 9 and 10. It&amp;rsquo;s too cold to start earlier. Keep adjusting the clothing, based on how cold/warm it is, and the wind chill. Keep munching, or sipping on some water (plain or mixed with some energizer). Continue pedaling, and start looking at the milestones a little more carefully. Lunch is on our mind, already. Lunch at around 1:30pm - usually, a couple of boiled eggs, and a potato. May be a chocolate, and some Frooti. More pedaling. The kilometers start getting harder, the chill is getting harsher. Huff and puff, and reach our camp for the day. Hi-fives! We&amp;rsquo;d try and reach the camp while there is still some sunlight there to keep us warm. Stretch it out, and switch into dry, warm clothes. Grab a quick snack - whole packets of biscuits would just disappear, alongside some tea. Talk, walk around, ponder about life, think about the day that&amp;rsquo;s been, think about the day that is to come, and all that jazz. Eat dinner - dal and rice, mostly. Sleep like logs. Unless, there&amp;rsquo;s a rat in the room that&amp;rsquo;s attacking our dry fruits.  What was the most enjoyable part of the ride?  I really enjoyed sitting at Deepak Tal, and just looking at the clear water The climb to Baralacha La was the most challenging part of the ride. We could see that the weather was really bad in all the peaks around us, and it was getting really cold. Briefly, it was even snowing very lightly and we could see tiny snow flakes floating in front of us. The feeling of reaching the top of passes was quite thrilling, for both Rohtang and Baralacha La. Nakee La, not so much, since we still had about 30km ahead of us to finish the day. It was humbling to see all the BRO folks working to keep the roads open and functional! A big salute to them! Each time we had a truck or some bikers pass by, we would wave at them or show thumbs up, and it would give us some additional energy to keep pushing ahead. The tree covered road in Sissu was just mind blowingly beautiful, with all the trees golden and yellow, preparing for the fall. It was also nice to turn 30, in the hills. Vivek tried to make it as special, for me, as he could.  What was the most challenging part of the ride? The cold. (See, the answer on why we didn&amp;rsquo;t finish the ride).
You keep saying it was cold, how cold was it really? On the night we camped at Sarchu, the water in our bottles and unwashed cups had frozen. We had gone to sub zero temperatures on many nights, it looks like. The winds during the day were quite chilly, and got worse as we gained altitude.
Did you meet any interesting people en-route?  We met a guy from Slovenia who has been taking a couple or so months off for the past 10 years. He was riding around with a 55kg weighing bike for the past 3 weeks, and was going from Leh to Manali, when we met him. He had a lot of stories to tell &amp;ndash; including recommending that we go cycling in Iceland, and enjoy watching the Northern lights from hot water baths.
 Shabu himself had a lot of stories to tell about all the people he had taken on this ride - from guys with a $6k bike to a 70 year old doing the route his 4th time to the guy who would eat only olive oil mixed in rice to safeguard his tummy, and more!
 All the aachos and aamas in the shops/guest houses/etc that we went to were really nice to us. Most of the folks in the shops were planning to leave in a few days after we had met them since it had gotten really cold.
 We had our camp-site at Marhi in the compound of a HP state guest house. The care taker walks up to us, while we are setting up the tent, and says, &amp;ldquo;Idhar kahi par bhi baithna mana hai, 10 hazaar ka fine lag jaayega. Udhar toilet bana hua hai&amp;rdquo;, pointing to the public toilets in a distance, &amp;ldquo;paisa nahi lagega&amp;rdquo;. We had a good laugh, and ended up wondering if it was Swach Bharat showing some effect.
  We probably would&amp;rsquo;ve talked to a lot more people, and met a lot more interesting people, if we were there in better weather and didn&amp;rsquo;t have a support vehicle taking care of us. Next time!
Would you do this again? May be. We feel like we got a taste of the challenge of the ride, and the rest of the route wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be anymore challenging than what we already saw, if we did it in better weather. But, the better weather would also mean more traffic and noise on the road.
If yes, which part of the year would you do it? Late August to mid-September might be a better time. We&amp;rsquo;d also need to look out for rains and land-slides, though.
If not, what other routes would you try?  Cycling around Europe sounds like a fun thing to try Rides in the western ghats and/or Kerala seem promising A Tour of Meghalaya was something a friend suggested Pushing that a little more, ride all the way to Singapore/Indonesia, starting at home  Do you have any pictures that you can share?

      <title>Prime Ministers of India - Simple d3 timeline</title>

      <description>I have been working on a simple time-line showing the terms of Prime Ministers of India. Currently, the time-line is not very useful and only shows the duration of the term in the time0line, with some pictures, with the hover tool-tip linking to a Wikipedia page. The interactive version is here.
A simple extension of this would be to add historical events of different types over this time-line, with links to more information on these events. I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure, where I&amp;rsquo;m going with this, though.
Any ideas and suggestions are more than welcome.</description>

      <title>Emacs frame as a pop-up input</title>
      <link>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/emacs-frame-as-a-pop-up-input/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2017 22:26:00 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/emacs-frame-as-a-pop-up-input/</guid>
      <description>I wanted to try using a dialog box/pop-up window as a prompt to remind me to periodically make journal entries. I had the following requirements:
 Simple, light-weight dialog box that allows text of arbitrary length Ability to launch the dialog from the shell Ability to have some placeholder or template text, each time the dialog is shown Save the input text to a specific org-mode file Write as little code of my own, as possible, to do this  I had initially thought about using a tool like zenity, or write a simple dialog box in Python using Qt, wx or even tk, and then yank the input text at the desired location. This probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have turned out to be too hard, but getting things to look and work exactly the way I wanted would have required more code than I was willing to write or maintain.
After avoiding doing this for a while, I finally realized that I could simply use Emacs with a new frame with the appropriate dimensions, and with the correct file/buffer open to the desired location. This would
 eliminate the need for me to write the UI myself eliminate the need to do text manipulation in code, to yank it at the right place, in the right form. By directly opening up the editor at the required location, the onus is on me (as a text inputting user) to put it in, the way I want it. additionally provide me the comfort of being able to write with the full power of Emacs - keybindings and all that jazz. let me leverage elisp to do essentially whatever I want with the buffer being displayed as the dialog box.  I ended up with a command that looks something like this
emacsclient -c -n\ -F &#39;((title . &amp;quot;Title&amp;quot;) (left . (+ 550)) (top . (+ 400)) (width . 110) (height . 12))&#39;\ -e &#39;(pc/open-journal-buffer)&#39;   This worked pretty nicely, except for the fact that with gnome-shell, the pop-up frame doesn&amp;rsquo;t always appear raised. It often gets hidden in the Emacs windows group, and the whole idea of the pop-up acting as a reminder goes for a toss! But, thanks to this Ask Ubuntu post, I could fix this pretty easily.
emacsclient -c -n\ -F &#39;((title . &amp;quot;Title&amp;quot;) (left . (+ 550)) (top . (+ 400)) (width . 110) (height . 12))&#39;\ -e &#39;(progn (pc/open-journal-buffer) (raise-frame) (x-focus-frame (selected-frame)))&#39;  </description>

      <title>Blog trends from word clouds</title>
      <link>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/blog-trends-from-word-clouds/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2017 22:15:00 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/blog-trends-from-word-clouds/</guid>
      <description>I came across a couple of fun word clouds, and felt like generating a word cloud for my blog content to get a sense of the major themes on my blog, over the years.
With some simple Python code, I was able to parse the blog and get the word frequency over the years. I then used a modified version of this d3 example to generate a word cloud.
Using all the words used in each year to generate the word-cloud, made it very noisy. So, I switched to using only the top 50 words for each year.
 The word cloud doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem very useful or insightful, but was fun to generate. Each year&amp;rsquo;s cloud seems to have some words that gives me a sense of some major events/themes for that year, though it may not be very apparent to anybody other than me.
The years which have a lot of posts have clear winners, but the winning words are quite generic. For example, 2007 has words like &amp;ldquo;life&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo;, etc., as winners. To try to get rid of the generic words in the word cloud, I tried a quick and dirty tf-idf based word-cloud, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t really seem to help.
 I might get back to this later, to try and improve the tf=idf word cloud. There are also other problems, like code-blocks in posts contributing variable names, urls contributing domain names, etc.
Also, a simple line chart of the usage of tags vs. year might give a better sense of the themes in the blog by year, even though it may not look as fancy as a word-cloud.</description>

      <title>30 years of floods in India</title>
      <link>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/30-years-of-floods-in-india/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2017 19:01:00 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/30-years-of-floods-in-india/</guid>
      <description>Inspired by this post showing the major flooding events in the US, I created a similar graphic for India. You can find an interactive version here &amp;ndash; hovering over each flooding, shows some more information about the event.
 The graphic uses flooding related data from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory The data for 2017 events is not up-to date. It is very likely that there is some missing data, and some inaccuracies in the data. 1987, for instance, doesn&amp;rsquo;t show the Bihar flood. The flood severity is indicated by the color of each shape Each shape represents the geographic flood extents - based on information obtained from news sources. The data for India map shape is obtained from this topojson collection  It is interesting to look at the severity definitions here &amp;ndash; the extreme class floods, for instance, are defined to be those that have an estimated recurrence interval of over 100 years. In a span of 30 odd years, there are a whole bunch of regions which have been affected by extreme floods. Yet another case in point showing that the climate change shit has really hit the roof!
Code I used ogr2ogr to convert the shape file obtained from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory
ogr2ogr -f geoJSON data/floods.json FloodArchive_region.shp  This file turned out to be about 6MB. I created a file with only Indian floods by parsing the json file.
import json with open(&#39;floods.json&#39;, encoding=&#39;latin-1&#39;) as f: data = json.load(f) india_features = [ feature for feature in data[&#39;features&#39;] if feature[&#39;properties&#39;][&#39;COUNTRY&#39;] == &#39;India&#39; ] data[&#39;features&#39;] = india_features # FIX some names in the data NAME_FIXES = [ (&#39;Tropical Storm K&#39;, &#39;Tropical Storm Komen&#39;), (&#39;Tropical Storm Hudhug&#39;, &#39;Tropical Storm Hudhud&#39;), ] for feature in india_features: for name, fix in NAME_FIXES: cause = feature[&#39;properties&#39;][&#39;MAINCAUSE&#39;] if name in cause: feature[&#39;properties&#39;][&#39;MAINCAUSE&#39;] = cause.replace(name, fix) with open(&#39;india-floods.json&#39;, &#39;w&#39;, encoding=&#39;latin-1&#39;) as f: json.dump(data, f)  The visualization code itself is about a hundred odd lines of d3 code.</description>

      <description>This week was a busy one, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t really consume too much web content.
A colleague mentioned that he was reading the book &amp;ndash; The Millennial Project: Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps and it seemed to have some interesting ideas that I&amp;rsquo;ve never come across before.
The Berklee Indian Ensemble performed at the Bengaluru Ganesh Utsava and I went along with Sunil to their performance, which we thoroughly loved.
I liked some of Chet Baker instrumentals that I listened to this week.</description>

      <description>I liked this article advising developers on having healthy relationships. Most of it is common sense stuff &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Whether it be a side project or main project, understand that sacrificing relationships isn&amp;rsquo;t worth it.&amp;rdquo;
I really enjoyed this article by Priyanka on how she started talking to Auto Drivers. She shares a bunch of stories of drivers she talked to, that makes me wonder how many more such stories just go unheard, because I don&amp;rsquo;t talk.
@scopatz wrote up a nice argument explaining why @github should add back BSD to the list of licenses shown on the site. It taught me a thing or two about BSD and MIT.
I enjoyed spending the weekend at @mavin&amp;rsquo;s place, discussing continuous improvement in life, among other things. Also, had a lot of fun playing Psyche. The game is so addictive, but the app is not all that great. Someone should make a more robust app for this, or something that piggybacks on an existing network service like Telegram or Facebook chat or Google hangouts.
Falling In Love At A Coffee Shop by Landon Pigg is a lovely song, that I discovered this week.</description>

      <description>Vox has a nice short video on shutting up about the y-axis &amp;ndash; It&amp;rsquo;s long past time to say no to y-axis fundamentalism, they say.
The New York Times has a great visual history of which countries have dominated the Summer Olympics.
This story of Dipa by ESPN is an inspirational read.
An old post on a Frameless Geodesic Dome that Bruce Hauman (of Figwheel fame) built himself is very cool!

      <description>I create public Jupyter notebooks once in a while, to collaborate with a friend, or to make it easier for myself to work with data on a remote machine.
Each time I need to look up the docs, and manually set-up a few things, before I can start using the notebook.
I just wrote a bash script that does the following, quickly -
 Install Jupyter into a temporary virtualenv Create certificate files Start the server with https enabled and a password Delete all temporary files, when the server is shutdown   You can get it here, if you&amp;rsquo;d like to use it.</description>

      <description>NYTimes has been doing some amazing visualizations for the Olympics and this time lapse visualization of Bolt&amp;rsquo;s 100m Gold is great!
The History Project produced a book called Partitioned Histories that tries to contrast the narratives of India and Pakistan on their histories using school history text books. What a great idea!
This video about the Sunshine Orchestra being trained and tutored by Rahman and his KM Music Conservatory is touching.
Julia Evans&amp;rsquo; posts on how to decide and think about what to work on are great. &amp;ldquo;Even reliably recognizing good ideas is hard!&amp;rdquo;, she says, and this resonates with me. Writing a release email as a way to think about why you are doing something is great!
Jasdev wrote about his monthly check-ins with friends. I thought they were such a great idea - simple, yet, powerful. &amp;ldquo;The only regret I have about these checkins is not starting sooner.&amp;ldquo;, he writes.
This Vox article on America&amp;rsquo;s increasing wealth gap along racial lines is really well done and thought provoking.</description>

      <description>TL;DR
 Am I saying India doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a caste problem?
No, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely a HUGE problem!
 Are these articles on Google Trends and Sindhu&amp;rsquo;s caste useful at all?
Just more click-baits and no useful contribution to the discussion on caste.
  First of all, congratulations to PV Sindhu on making it to the finals and giving the world number one a hard fight!
This post, though, is not a celebratory one. I read this article &amp;ndash; While PV Sindhu fought hard for a medal, many Indians googled her caste &amp;ndash; by the News Minute thanks to a re-tweet by TM Krishna. I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have paid much attention to it, if not for the retweet by TMK.
Caste is a huge problem for the country, and if you still like to pretend it isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ndash; read this for a start. I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised that some people searched for Sindhu&amp;rsquo;s caste while she was battling it out at Rio. But, some people also searched for Badminton rules, and others for Sania Mirza! What surprises me is that the article doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to put the data in a context at all. Nor do I understand the contribution this article makes to the discussion on caste.
 I played around a little more with these search terms and Google Trends, and here are a few things that I thought were worth sharing.
Indian trends First of all, the article says &amp;ldquo;Many Indians&amp;rdquo;, and gives off cumulative month-wise numbers (UPDATE [2016-08-21 Sun 12:15]: which are so wrong! See Sankrant Sanu&amp;rsquo;s excellent article on India Facts). But, what does it really mean?
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if anybody actually wrote about how many people actually followed the match, but Sindhu actually managed to get a whole lot of people interested!
 More people searched for PV Sindhu than the daily average number of searches (not hits) for Facebook and very close to the daily number of searches for Porn &amp;ndash; two of the biggest things Internet is allegedly used for. Can you see the red line at the bottom? That is the number of people who actually searched for Sindhu&amp;rsquo;s caste &amp;ndash; a tiny blip.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look. Here&amp;rsquo;s a plot of some of the other auto suggest terms + badminton rules &amp;amp; courts compared to Sindhu&amp;rsquo;s name.
 Nothing other than badminton rules (which is at about 1% of max. searches) is even visible, clearly.
So, these other terms (wiki &amp;amp; caste being auto-suggested ones) are nowhere near the actual number of searches being made for PV Sindhu&amp;rsquo;s name alone.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get rid of the name graph to get a closer look at the other terms.
  The maximum number of people searching for Sindhu&amp;rsquo;s caste is at about a fifth of the maximum number of people searching for badminton rules. Interpreting it is upto you. But, I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised knowing how significant caste has been in our society. Also, notice that searches for wiki and caste fall off more gradually than the searches for the rules which peak while the game is being played and watched.
 Unsurprisingly, a bulk of the searches appear to be coming from Andhra and Telangana. Notice that the other states are searching more for the rules or her wiki page.
    Do you notice that the red (caste), blue (wiki) and violet (images) lines following a similar trend, until the last few hours? What do you think is happening there? It&amp;rsquo;s the shitty click baits working! Look at the trends from ~8:30AM to ~12:30AM below &amp;ndash; the red has spread to other states as well!    And this is how it looks by the evening (17:00-21:00). Well done, folks! The click bait articles totally succeeded!   If you are wondering how much effect the auto suggestions are having in suggesting people to try searching for caste, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that is much because wiki and images are the other auto-suggest terms, with no such surges in the number of searches.
Trends from the Telugu states We could see that the two Telugu states were more worried about the caste, than the rest of the country. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how abnormal they are.
  You can definitely see the red line more prominently. In case of Andhra the peak searches for caste are at about 5% of the name searches. A statistically significant difference from the rest of the country.
Let&amp;rsquo;s zoom in at the auto-suggest terms alone.
  Woah, Andhra is definitely quite an aberration from the rest of the country. From about 1/5th of the maximum number of searches for rules, the maximum number of caste searches jumps to about twice. Telangana also is different, but much less so.
Tamil Nadu&amp;rsquo;s trends below for comparison. You can&amp;rsquo;t help noticing the last few hours, can you?
 NOTE: The trends and screen-shots for the states are slightly more recent than the others.
Conclusion Without a context, I don&amp;rsquo;t really see the point of these &amp;ldquo;news&amp;rdquo; articles. It seems more click-bait-y than useful to me.
If you still feel many Indians were searching for Sindhu&amp;rsquo;s caste, while she was fighting it out, go ahead and play with Google trends here. Add/remove terms, change the time and location filters. Some terms that could be interesting to add to the comparison are: Kashmir, Independence day, Facebook.
Later, I looked at the search results and then found that this article wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only one like it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to read the others, but I really hope at least some of them are talking sense. Is any of them really trying to contribute to the discussion on caste, meaningfully?
Also, the actual search results don&amp;rsquo;t seem to give useful answers to the folks so curious about Sindhu&amp;rsquo;s caste. I hope none of these articles are trying to help them out.
Finally, if you are using Google Trends to write an article, Danny Page has some really good advice.
Thanks to Kamal, baali and 9 for reading and reviewing drafts of this. Errors mine, obviously.</description>

      <description>Great visualizations about how global temperatures have been changing in the last ~165 years. If you are still a global warming skeptic, you definitely must see them.
These visualizations of Michael Phelps&amp;rsquo; performances at Olympics over the years by NYTimes are great, too!
I came across these delightful videos (1, 2) of girls and boys playing cricket at Haji Public School. Look ma, no sexism in coverage of sports.
This (Telugu) interview of Dr Jayaprakash Narayan is truly inspiring. Also, YouTube recommended his conversation with Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, which was unexpectedly insightful, and covers a wide variety of topics &amp;ndash; spirituality, religion, social organizations, politics, socialism vs. capitalism.</description>

      <description>Lots of Olympics stuff this week!
I really liked this ad - Rukna Nahi Hai - wishing all the Olympians a wonderfully spirited competition, at Rio. Go!
Brazilian marathoner Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima, the man who lit the Olympic flame, inspires me with his spirit.
This story of Mohan Kumar from Ambattur, a Chennai suburb is inspiring. &amp;ldquo;Now I am on the relay team. But in the next Olympics, I want to qualify for the individual event. That&amp;rsquo;s my aim.&amp;ldquo;, he says.
@vandith recommended the Nike+ Training App to me and I really like it. They have some amazing workouts and pretty neat personalized workout plans.
Coke Studio Pakistan is trying a delightful experiment with their show this time &amp;ndash; they are trying to use lights and vibrations to let the hearing-impaired experience the music on their show better!
Sainath&amp;rsquo;s keynote at Film Writers Association conference was yet another of his thought-provoking speeches. He sends you down a spiral of thought, when he says, &amp;ldquo;How agonised we are when people die, and how untroubled we are by how they live&amp;rdquo;. I also enjoyed watching his (long) casual chat from an year ago, talking about his life and influences on him.
David Sassoon the founder of InsideClimate News writes about Non-Profit journalism, the need for it, and how to have more of it. He writes about it in the American context, but India has its own share of troubles. I consume quite a bit of news from independent sources, but don&amp;rsquo;t really contribute to keep them going. I should turn this around.
A bunch of residents of Urur Olcott Kuppam in Chennai responded to media&amp;rsquo;s broken coverage of TM Krishna&amp;rsquo;s Magsaysay award. I really liked how assertive they were about their role in the music festival, its role in their lives, and in clarifying how they see their fishing village as opposed to how the media portrayed it. They don&amp;rsquo;t mince any words.

      <title>Python reload and module dict</title>
      <link>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/python-reload-and-module-dict/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/python-reload-and-module-dict/</guid>
      <description>I was trying to play around with Nikola&amp;rsquo;s code today and learnt about a documented weirdness of Python&amp;rsquo;s reload.
 Below are two versions of code &amp;ndash; ORIGINAL and UPDATED respectively referring to the orginial code and the code after changes. The code only has a PLUGINS list, which is changed in each version of the code.
# Work in a temporary directory import os import tempfile os.chdir(tempfile.mkdtemp()) # Module content, original and updated ORIGINAL = &amp;quot;# PLUGINS = []&amp;quot; UPDATED = &amp;quot;PLUGINS = [&#39;rss&#39;]&amp;quot; def create_conf_file(content): &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Create a conf.py module with given content.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; with open(&#39;conf.py&#39;, &#39;w&#39;) as f: f.write(content)  conf doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a PLUGINS attribute in the ORIGINAL code. It&amp;rsquo;s been commented out!
create_conf_file(ORIGINAL) import conf # PLUGINS is not defined in the module, originally. print(conf.PLUGINS)  The code for conf has been updated, but the module doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet have a PLUGINS attribute, since the new module isn&amp;rsquo;t imported until we reload.
create_conf_file(UPDATED) import conf print(conf.PLUGINS)  PLUGINS has the expected value, after the reload
import importlib importlib.reload(conf) print(conf.PLUGINS)  What happens when we revert to the ORIGINAL code, and reload the module?
# We write back the original file. PLUGINS should be empty! create_conf_file(ORIGINAL) import conf importlib.reload(conf) print(conf.PLUGINS, &amp;quot;&amp;lt;---Whaaaat!&amp;quot;)   The behavior is well documented, along with a reasoning of why it is the way it is, but you can trip over it if you don&amp;rsquo;t know. I hit a bug and was wondering if there was a race condition somewhere, until I read the docs for reload. On reload, the module dict is updated, instead of creating a new dict. Any values not redefined in the new code for the module remain unchanged.</description>

      <title>Assist time</title>
      <link>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/assist-time/</link>

      <guid>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/assist-time/</guid>
      <description>I sometimes hang out on #org-mode or #nikola and answer questions. I usually am not able to answer off the top of my head and I look up docs or dig through the code. Sometimes, we find ready-made documented answers, but other times we end up contributing some documentation, filing an issue, submitting a patch or hacking up something for that super-special use-case.
Until now, I looked at this time as IRC time, which loosely translates to distraction time. But, I&amp;rsquo;m usually learning about the tools I use a little bit more. Even when I&amp;rsquo;m not, I&amp;rsquo;m helping someone do something they want to do. Sometimes empowering them to fix future problems on their own. And indirectly making the user community a wee-bit happier, and possibly the software a tiny bit better.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t limited just to helping someone on IRC. Helping out a co-worker do something that they are new to, or just adding a comment or editing a Stack-overflow answer may end up in the &amp;ldquo;distraction time&amp;rdquo; bin, just because you weren&amp;rsquo;t doing something on your TODO list. It needn&amp;rsquo;t be.
Taking cue from scorers in Football, I decided to call this time assist time and to try to start seeing this time as (semi-)productive. Naming helps.</description>

      <description>That dense book you want to read but has been lying on your desk while you procrastinate on twitter. You know you&amp;rsquo;ll have to tune everything else out, and read slowly, word by word, trying to understand and make sense.
That vague blog post idea swirling in your head while you look at cat pictures, one after another. Distilling your thoughts and putting them down for general consumption is a lot of thinking and effort away.
That ${cool_programming_thing} that a talk got you excited about so long ago. But, watching talks and intending to start using it is all you do about it. You know its going to take a fair amount of reading, thinking and time, before you can really use it well.
Like all those squats and lifts you dread, these things are building your muscle. The thing about building muscle &amp;ndash; it needs effort and feels like so much hard work.
You can&amp;rsquo;t build muscles effortlessly. Go do those effortful things! Only if you care about those muscles, anyway.</description>

      <title>Better styling bookmarklet</title>

      <guid>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/better-styling-bookmarklet/</guid>
      <description>Some sites that I like a lot for their content, have zero styling on them. I find it pretty hard to read when the lines are long and I have to read all the way on my screen.
I had a simple bookmarklet until now that just changed the width of the page.
document.getElementsByTagName(&#39;body&#39;)[0].setAttribute(&#39;style&#39;, &#39;width: 600px&#39;)  Kamal shared with me a recommendation for 7 simple styling rules that will make pages easier to read. I liked them, and modified my bookmarklet to use these rules now.
 Drag and drop the link below onto your bookmarks bar if you want to use it.
Better website
The code in a readable format is below.
// Create new stylesheet (function() { // Create the &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; tag var style = document.createElement(&amp;quot;style&amp;quot;); // Add the &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; element to the page document.head.appendChild(style); // Add rules from bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com var sheet = style.sheet; sheet.insertRule(&amp;quot;body{ margin:40px auto; max-width:650px; line-height:1.6; font-size:18px; color:#444; padding:0 10px; }&amp;quot;); sheet.insertRule(&amp;quot;h1,h2,h3{ line-height:1.2 }&amp;quot;); })();  Update [2016-06-07 Tue]: baali pointed me to Firefox&amp;rsquo;s Reader View which works well too.</description>

      <title>Reading-time based scheduling</title>

      <guid>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/reading-time-based-scheduling/</guid>
      <description>I had posted a link to an poem written on Medium on a Slack channel that I use with friends. A friend said that she liked the fact that the Slack article preview had the reading time from Medium in it. She could decide whether or not she wanted to read the poem or any other article at that moment.
This gave me the idea for a reading time extension for my browser, or my feed reader or my bookmarks &amp;ndash; my reading list. The first version should be able to compute or extract the reading time for an article or a tab in my browser, and index them. I want to be able to specify the amount of time I will be able to spend reading, and be presented with something from my reading list. I think this would help with scheduling the reading of longer articles, and also to actually help me get through my reading list.
Reading time estimates that use heuristics based on word-count may not really work, and may do more harm than good. But, it may still be worth a try to see if it helps my reading habits in any way. A quick search pointed me to this extension, that can give the reading time for any page but doesn&amp;rsquo;t really do what I want.</description>

      <description>In the past few weeks, I noticed three instances where I was forced to take a break exactly when I was ready to jump in and write some code to fix a bug or add a small feature. I had to step out of the house and take a walk to meet someone, etc.
I ended up getting ideas during the walks, which significantly changed and simplified how I would&amp;rsquo;ve implemented things, if not for those breaks. Even if I did end up zeroing down to those solutions, I am pretty sure it would&amp;rsquo;ve taken a couple of not-so-good attempts and much longer than it did.
Context switches are usually considered to be expensive for programmers, but taking a break at the exact time when I had all the required context loaded into my head seemed to help. It was also probably helpful that I was taking a walk, and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t really any other inputs or outputs competing for the space in my head.
This got me thinking about doing this more deliberately &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear about any experiences or any experiments any of you have done with this. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of Rich Hickey&amp;rsquo;s Hammock Driven Development talk and I wonder if this is a smaller/different version of it, and makes me want to try out the things he suggests more deliberately. If any of you has thoughts and suggestions, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you!</description>

      <title>PyCon India 2016 - Propose a talk</title>
      <link>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/pycon-india-2016-propose-a-talk/</link>

      <description> CFP for PyCon 2016 is open and you should propose a talk!
There has been a lot of discussion on trying to improve the talk quality at the events. As my bit of contribution to this, below is a re-hash of some good advice from the internet on why you should give a talk, and how to submit a good proposal.
Why?  You needn&amp;rsquo;t be an expert on a topic. If you have enough experience about something to help make the next person&amp;rsquo;s experience with it better, you are good.
 Its a great way to find people who are interested in the same things as you are and to get to talk to them. If you are an introvert, you should definitely be speaking!
 Proposing and giving a talk is about thinking about something hard enough to refine your thoughts, and being able to explain it to others. Its a useful skill to hone.
  How?  Talks are entertainment. Pick a topic that you are excited about and fascinated by. Let it be a general topic that will have a significant number of people interested in it.
 What you want the attendees to be telling their friends about your talk, after they go back. Make it the objective of your talk.
 Submit a complete, clear and compelling proposal. Show the reviewers that you are willing to put in the effort to prepare for and to give a great talk. Here are a bunch of proposals to see and learn from.
 Submit an outline along with your talk. Show the talk can be delivered in the given time and will be interesting. Include an indication of how much time you intend to spend on each part of your talk.
 Choose a good title. The title is what catches the attention of your audience when they are trying to pick a talk. Avoid buzz words.
 Get feedback. Like any writing, feedback can be helpful at all stages &amp;ndash; brainstorm while choosing topics to getting critique on the full abstract.
 Convince the reviewers that you can give a well-rehearsed and entertaining &amp;ndash; link to previous talks you&amp;rsquo;ve given, include links to any testimonials you&amp;rsquo;ve received from your audience, etc. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a previously recorded talk, give a small talk to your friends or colleagues and have it recorded.
  References  PyCon US has some good advice on how to submit a proposal and most of it is generic enough for you to use for PyCon India, or any other conference.
 These posts (1 2 and more) by Jesse Davis are so so good!
 I also liked &amp;ldquo;The Talk on Talks&amp;rdquo; by Zach Holman.

      <description>The Ministry of Home Affairs put out a draft and an RFC for a Geo-spatial bill
 To regulate the acquisition, dissemination, publication and distribution of geospatial information of India which is likely to affect the security, sovereignty and integrity of India.
 Even if you put aside questions about how a vetting process, for &amp;ldquo;dealing with&amp;rdquo; any geospatial information, would help with the said goals, the bill defines geospatial information so broadly that even taking a geo-tagged picture at the Taj mahal or sharing the location of your house for a meal delivery would have you breaking the law.
A group of volunteers made Save the map which has more information on this, along with a draft response that you can send to the Ministry. Please respond before June 2nd, 2016.</description>

      <title>Thinking about Data Ethics</title>

      <description>Earlier this month, a researcher made a dataset containing the profiles of about 70,000 users public. He didn&amp;rsquo;t really see a problem in doing this because he felt he was only presenting already publicly available data in a more usable form. was only presenting it in a more usable form.
Yesterday, I came across this quote in the very first chapter of Allen Downey&amp;rsquo;s book Think Stats which I liked a lot, and reminded me of this incident.
 I hadn&amp;rsquo;t looked at the OKCupid data release and the discussion around it much, but I went back and read this article by a social media researcher who thinks a lot about these things.
She puts forth a lot of interesting ideas to think about ethics. Some things that stood out to me are:
 Ask yourself how the person whose data you are using feels about the data. Taking a &amp;lsquo;what if&amp;rsquo; impact approach to thinking about data and ethics.  Also, you needn&amp;rsquo;t really call yourself a researcher to be actually doing experiments with (or analyzing) &amp;ldquo;big-data&amp;rdquo; and discovering and putting out facts that have an impact &amp;ndash; however big or small. You should really go read the article, whether or not you are a researcher using data.
Incidentally, there is a meet-up on Data Ethics this weekend in Bangalore. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to learn and think more about this, and talk to others who care.</description>

      <title>Level-up Tools</title>
      <link>https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/level-up-tools/</link>

      <description>Thanks to a friend I got an upgrade to our still-being-setup kitchen. I now have a non-stick pan along with a few more new additions. I would previously use a bowl that people usually use to boil milk etc. for making whatever I did. The non-stick pan feels so great! It has made it a lot simpler to make some of the things I used to, because its non-stick. And it has vastly expanded the possibilities of things I can make, by virtue of being flat and wide based. The pan is such a great addition to my kitchen paraphernalia, and it adds a new dimension to the kind of things I can make. I&amp;rsquo;m not here to write a user review for it, though.
What are such tools in other things that you do, that drastically changed the way you did something, or added a new dimension to the kinds of things you could do, tools that make you feel like you have a new super-power? Learning to write Python (after starting off with C) seemed to give me so much power allowing me to focus on the problem, rather than fussing over the low level details. Sasha mentions in this post how using a Spaced Repetition System like Anki drastically improved her efficiency because she could focus on thinking about higher level things rather than trying to recall or search for what method or function to use to do something.
What are some such level-up tools for you? Is there a systematic approach to discovering tools?</description>

      <description>Another post about blogging.
blog-admin now supports Nikola, thanks to yours truly. blog-admin is an Emacs package by CodeFalling that lets you view and manage your (static site generated) blog from within inside Emacs.
Nikola&amp;rsquo;s command line utility is pretty nifty and does a bunch of useful things. I had a few utility functions to do common tasks like create new post and deploy blog. This worked well, but moment I came across this blog-admin&amp;rsquo;s tabular view, I was sold!
org2blog (a blogging tool I used previously) had a tracking file that kept track of all the posts I made, and I used it quite a bit for navigation &amp;ndash; thanks to org-mode&amp;rsquo;s search functionality. The tabular view of blog-admin is even better! I really like the fact that the author has tried to keep the package generic enough to support any blog, and adding support for Nikola has been quite easy.
The filtering functionality is crude, but good enough for a start. One thing I want to add is a preview functionality for drafts. Showing some (writing) statistics would also be nice &amp;ndash; No. posts in the last month, total published posts, etc. No promises, but you may see some of these things, soon. :)</description>

      <description>I first heard of this book in a discussion on relationships amongst friends from RC. The discussion was quite interesting and the book received more than a couple of strong recommendations. So, I decided to pick it up.
Very simply, the book is codified common sense explaining what Love is. Gary Chapman, the author, started with the question &amp;ldquo;What makes you feel loved&amp;rdquo; and found that the answers could be grouped into the following 5 categories:
 Words of affirmation Quality time Receiving gifts Acts of service Physical touch,  which he calls the languages of love. He also proposes that people have a primary language of love, and a failure to speak to a person in their primary language would make them feel unloved.
The book is filled with anecdotes to explain what each of these languages means and how to speak them, along with practical advice and exercises to learn to speak each of these languages. Though the book has been written with couples in mind, the fundamental ideas in this book can be applied to any relationships. I feel like it has been helping me connect a few dots, ever since I&amp;rsquo;ve started reading it.
It has been totally worth my time to read this book. A highly recommended read!
Below are some of my notes. Feel free to suggest improvements (for readability and otherwise) on the notes.</description>
