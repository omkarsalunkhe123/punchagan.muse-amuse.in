Don&amp;rsquo;t tell me I didn&amp;rsquo;t warn you, if you walk into our lab sometime and mistake it for a game zone in your neighbourhood. You are indeed in &amp;ldquo;the&amp;rdquo; lab. If you came looking for Prof. Prabhu you&amp;rsquo;ll have to return. You&amp;rsquo;ll only find PR vowing to see the end of baali, for having a nice time pawning him. You won&amp;rsquo;t find me around - I&amp;rsquo;m cloaked and busy creating havoc. Unless, of course, you are the seer KD. Watch your step extremely carefully or you won&amp;rsquo;t know when and how fuchmed&amp;rsquo;s GM hit you. And don&amp;rsquo;t dare venture anywhere near madrazr, jumping all around with a shockwave, unless you are capable enjoying some real nasty shocks. Well, the team is busy in one of it&amp;rsquo;s two SB sessions per day. SB (short for Stress Buster) sessions are intense 15 minute rounds of bzflag - 3D first person tank battle game.
Hope you didn&amp;rsquo;t start thinking, I&amp;rsquo;m just goofing off here, doing nothing at all. If it&amp;rsquo;s not already clear, SB sessions are exactly what they are called - Stress Busters. Just to refresh ourselves and get back to work, with greater force. What then, am I doing for the rest of my time?
Mainly I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing course content that we have been working on, called Software Tools, Techniques and Practices. I have been working on a session for elementary LaTeX and basic Linux tools. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been attending classes of Digital Control and trying to Python-ize the Matlab/Scilab code that the course uses.
But, that&amp;rsquo;s not all. I&amp;rsquo;ve helped a guy restore a Joomla site on Day-1. I screwed up a brand new installation of a server with some real skill; then expect to be screwed but get some encouragement with the words, &amp;ldquo;It was a good learning experience for us.&amp;rdquo; Seen a Debian server upgrade from Etch to Lenny in under 10 minutes. Installed an instance of twiki and struggled to configure it. Helped a Humanities Scholar with LaTeX. Attended a workshop on Instruction Design. Restored Qmail on an old Fedora 3 server. Goofed around in gimp, for a CD cover and a T-shirt design. Chipped in with bits, for mutating Ubuntu into &amp;ldquo;LivePython&amp;rdquo;. Did a bit of css and javascript tweaking&amp;hellip; The list goes on!
Now, don&amp;rsquo;t you think we deserve the SB&amp;rsquo;s? ;)</description>
