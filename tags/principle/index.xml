      <description> The Apprenticeship patterns book is very interesting! I shall continue to read it and start create daily/weekly rituals from the actions prescribed in the book! I was reading this post on git gc, reflog, etc. and wanted to see what the default values were for some of the configurable variables. But, the git config command didn&amp;rsquo;t help. Developer/code defaults are also a part of the &amp;ldquo;config&amp;rdquo; system, and any tools to inspect config variables should display them, if no other values have been set explicitly! &amp;ldquo;If experience is built upon failure as much as success, then you need a more or less private space where you can seek out failure.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Apprenticeship Patterns. Our check-in groups changed, but 3 of us from our last check-in group are together again! Most of the day was spent with Git. In the morning, I learned that setting push.default to nothing will prevent pushing any branches without specifying explicitly which branch I want to push. Also, later in the day, Alan gave a presentation mapping the internals of git to the commands, trying to give everyone a better mental model of Git. I spent some time trying to get jedi integration for emacs. It should&amp;rsquo;ve worked out of the box, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the ELPA repositories have proper dependency/version management. Seems to be the problem, everywhere! Dependencies of a package get updated, and the package starts acting up&amp;hellip; Chaitu sent me a link about solving mazes using Finite Automata, and I spent some time trying to write a simple solver, and compare it with Nava&amp;rsquo;s breadth first search. But, it looks like we broke her code during the refactor. I may get back to this, at some point. I also spent a few minutes talking to Kyle, while he was trying to implement a simple version of the NTP protocol. The algorithm it turns out, is pretty simple. I started reading a little bit on crypt-analysis for Simple Substitution ciphers, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try implementing one of the algorithms today. The day ended with yummy pizza and video watching!
