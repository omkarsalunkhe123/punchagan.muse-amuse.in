      <description>A couple of days back.. one guy called greenmamba asked me.. &amp;ldquo;Why do you use Linux (GNU/Linux) and not Windows? What is it that makes LinuxGNU/Linux] so special for you?&amp;rdquo; I avoided that question then.. {I was in no mood of answering questions&amp;hellip; Exams had finished just the day before!!} I am trying to answer it now&amp;hellip; greenmamba also told me that Roopesh said, &amp;ldquo;I use it because I can look at the source code. I am allowed to look at how things work and fiddle with the way they work!&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; I knew it immediately that this was not the reason for me.[I rarely looked at source code&amp;hellip; and making changes to it.. haha..] So what is it? I think I can answer this question if I get back to the time when I started using Linux&amp;hellip;[hehe.. not too long ago!! :P]
So how did I start using GNU/Linux? How did &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; first meet? It was during last summer holidays.. that Voods sent me this link &amp;hellip; [I had definitely used GNU/Linux on a few occasions before&amp;hellip; but.. this was when I really began using it&amp;hellip;] and within hours I was a fan of GNU/Linux!\![and Richard M Stallman (RMS)]
So its the &amp;ldquo;philosophy&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; The philosophy of Free Software&amp;hellip; [Free as in Freedom, not as in Free Beer&amp;hellip;(English is a wierd wierd Language&amp;hellip;)]&amp;hellip; The philosophy of Open Source&amp;hellip; that brought me to it&amp;hellip; This song says it the best&amp;hellip;

Hoarders may get piles of money,
That is true, hackers, that is true.
But they cannot help their neighbors;
That&amp;rsquo;s not good, hackers, that&amp;rsquo;s not good.
When we have enough free software
At our call, hackers, at our call,
We&amp;rsquo;ll throw out those dirty licenses

now I continue to use it.. for a variety of reasons..[they are NOT in the order of their priority/importance]
 Firstly, using Linux gives me a sense of community&amp;hellip; a sense of oneness [this can&amp;rsquo;t happen with Windows.. because you can&amp;rsquo;t share stuff&amp;hellip; :-(] I have begun to hate the concept of Proprietary Software&amp;hellip; can you believe that.. &amp;ldquo;Sharing stuff.. makes us PIRATES!!&amp;rdquo;
 I am a growing fan of the Command Line&amp;hellip; It simply rocks!!
 There&amp;rsquo;s almost no problem of Viruses/Malware.. You simply don&amp;rsquo;t need an Anti-Virus..(that needs to be updated every night.. or u&amp;rsquo;ll have nightmares&amp;hellip;)
 Then there&amp;rsquo;s this wonderful concept of Live-CDs.. {specially Knoppix.. Its absolutely awesome!} It put me(us?) out of soup&amp;hellip; a lotta times&amp;hellip;
 The fiddle factor&amp;hellip; I have just started to fiddle with things(&amp;hellip;source codes&amp;hellip; I added a small feature to my dc-client Microdc2].. the feature of away messages.. it feels gr8! :P)
 One of my best friend is using it too! [you know who&amp;hellip;]
 The Mascot looks cool!! ;) [I liked the GNU mascot too! (It&amp;rsquo;s on my side-bar) ]
 The name &amp;ldquo;LINUX&amp;rdquo;!! [There&amp;rsquo;s so many flavors(Distros) of Linux.. that I can keep trying different ones.. all my life :P.. presently with Slackware!]
 Its Fun!! and I want to use it&amp;hellip;
 and finally&amp;hellip; Windows sucks! [I don&amp;rsquo;t have to use it&amp;hellip; :P]!!
  Value your freedom or you will lose it, teaches history. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t bother us with politics,&amp;rdquo; respond those who don&amp;rsquo;t want to learn. &amp;ndash;Richard Stallman
When you say, &amp;ldquo;I wrote a program that crashed Windows&amp;rdquo;, people just stare at you blankly and say, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I got those with the system, for free&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ndash;Linus Torvalds
&amp;ldquo;What happens when you read some doc and either it doesn&amp;rsquo;t answer your question or is demonstrably wrong? In Linux, you say &amp;ldquo;Linux sucks&amp;rdquo; and go read the code. In Windows/Oracle/etc you say &amp;ldquo;Windows sucks&amp;rdquo; and start banging your head against the wall.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; Denis Vlasenko on linux kernel mailing list
&amp;ldquo;The box said that I needed to have Windows 98 or better&amp;hellip; so I installed Linux.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; LinuxNewbie.org</description>
