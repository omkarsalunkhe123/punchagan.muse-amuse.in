      <description> This Friday we worked on building our own URL shorteners. It was a fun exercise, and I built one that is not persistent, in the two hours. I worked on a not so important problem of having sorted query parameters, instead of the more important problem of having a persistent server. Anyway, I should be building something that works, first, before trying to solve the more interesting problems. At least on Fridays. I watched this old but interesting talk by Brandon Rhodes, titled The Mighty Dictionary, and played around with his _dictinfo module after-wards. I spent the rest of the evening reading up about Markov chains and Hidden Markov Models. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to finally understand what these terms mean, after seeing them being thrown around for so many years!  </description>
