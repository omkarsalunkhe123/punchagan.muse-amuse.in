      <description>I was at the B.M Birla Science Musuem yesterday&amp;hellip; it was calm with no one in there.. the only people i could see were the sweepers and cleaners.. the place was dull and lifeless&amp;hellip; I dint like it.. but slowly.. as the afternoon progressed.. people started coming in and by 5 in the evening.. there were quite a few in. The museum seemed to have sprung to life suddenly&amp;hellip; there was a lot of action all around with people enjoying in ( and trying to understand) the wonderful world of science&amp;hellip;.
A lot of kids had come along with their parents&amp;hellip; to dive into the world of science&amp;hellip; they were enjoying it&amp;hellip; the parents also turned into kids and were having great fun&amp;hellip; it was a great sight&amp;hellip; the parents tried their best to demistify the happenings&amp;hellip; those with a science background did it from thier knowledge.. the others patiently went through the explanations&amp;hellip;
The kids were thoroughly enjoying it&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know if they would later on in life remember what they learnt now&amp;hellip; but definitely a love for science and physics will be ignited in their hearts, it will fill their consciousness&amp;hellip; the spirit of curiosity will have multiplied manifold&amp;hellip; even the elders..connected with the child somewhere deep within themselves&amp;hellip; they too enjoyed the wonders of the world of science&amp;hellip;[and ofcourse the company and thrill in the eyes of their kids..] I too enjoyed the experience&amp;hellip; the experiments and the thrill of the others brought a smile to my face too&amp;hellip;. but it set me thinking&amp;hellip;
If science can inspire so much awe.. what&amp;rsquo;s happening at our engineering colleges? When people have the chance to learn a whole lot of science and put it to practical use&amp;hellip; why isn&amp;rsquo;t it that they are excited about it? Why is it that people just endup mugging a few formulae just before exams and get over with it? Where&amp;rsquo;s the problem? Where is that curiosity, all of us had as a child, lost?
I can recollect, in the last sem while doing experiments in the MT lab there wasn&amp;rsquo;t even a tenth of the awe or joy&amp;hellip; that i could see and feel at the museum&amp;hellip; why?? Is it that the child within us.. [the future engineers] dead? { If that&amp;rsquo;s true.. then the country is in deep trouble..} But I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s true&amp;hellip; I enjoyed my visit to the museum totally&amp;hellip;and I am sure every other &amp;lsquo;to be engineer&amp;rsquo; would have too.. then where&amp;rsquo;s the trouble?
I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly&amp;hellip; but I wonder if its because everything is equated to marks and grades&amp;hellip; all that matters to an engineering student [and the world around him/her..] is his/her CG or %age&amp;hellip; Is this what the country needs? Were the &amp;lsquo;temples of Learning&amp;rsquo;- the IIT&amp;rsquo;s and a whole lot of other technical institutions set-up for this very pupose? Of what use are those engineers to the country, who aren&amp;rsquo;t in awe of science and engineering, whose spirit of curiosity has been overpowered and suppressed by the present education system?
Isn&amp;rsquo;t it time we have a closer look at our education system&amp;hellip; why are we still sticking to the &amp;lsquo;British sytem&amp;rsquo; introduced during a colonial rule.. to break the back bone of our nation&amp;hellip; to supress our ability to think rationally.. to produce third rate clerks to work for them at lower wages? Why is the emphasis on marks and grades growing exponentially? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we start working to cut this growth at its root? Is this sytem good enough to produce &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; engineers, doctors, lawyers, journos, CA&amp;rsquo;s, architects, designers, writers, artists etc etc..
Where have all the gurukuls of the ancient past and the Santiniketans of the recent past gone? Isn&amp;rsquo;t the country in desparate need of more of these &amp;lsquo;temples of learning&amp;rsquo;??
The highest education is that which does not merely give us information but makes our life in harmony with all existence. &amp;ndash; Rabindranath Tagore
Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one&amp;rsquo;s living at it &amp;ndash;Albert Einstein</description>
