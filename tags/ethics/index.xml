      <description>Earlier this month, a researcher made a dataset containing the profiles of about 70,000 users public. He didn&amp;rsquo;t really see a problem in doing this because he felt he was only presenting already publicly available data in a more usable form. was only presenting it in a more usable form.
Yesterday, I came across this quote in the very first chapter of Allen Downey&amp;rsquo;s book Think Stats which I liked a lot, and reminded me of this incident.
 I hadn&amp;rsquo;t looked at the OKCupid data release and the discussion around it much, but I went back and read this article by a social media researcher who thinks a lot about these things.
She puts forth a lot of interesting ideas to think about ethics. Some things that stood out to me are:
 Ask yourself how the person whose data you are using feels about the data. Taking a &amp;lsquo;what if&amp;rsquo; impact approach to thinking about data and ethics.  Also, you needn&amp;rsquo;t really call yourself a researcher to be actually doing experiments with (or analyzing) &amp;ldquo;big-data&amp;rdquo; and discovering and putting out facts that have an impact &amp;ndash; however big or small. You should really go read the article, whether or not you are a researcher using data.
Incidentally, there is a meet-up on Data Ethics this weekend in Bangalore. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to learn and think more about this, and talk to others who care.</description>
