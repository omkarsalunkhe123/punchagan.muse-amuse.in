      <description>I was travelling in a bus today, when I overheard two people sitting behind me. One of the guy was telling the other about his brother&amp;rsquo;s job and the hardships he faces. The guy they were talking about, practically risks his life, to be able to eat a square meal. He works on Billboards, used to paint them and now that there aren&amp;rsquo;t enough people who get them painted, pastes the vinly posters on to the boards.
All day a guy struggles hard, to transform an ugly looking, old hoarding into a huge attractive advertisement and he is paid so well, that he has to slog it out to make ends meet for his family of four. They who get the paintings made or the posters put up, are striking it rich with loads of money and fame. Those who drive by, are having a good time watching that beautiful looking woman there or fantasizing themselves in that wonderful car up there. Then why is this person here, who slogs it out, making so many people happy, struggling to see a smile on his daughter?
When people around can get paid handsomely for having a jolly time in the air-conditioned room, puking out a few lines of code each day, can&amp;rsquo;t this guy, sweating it out in this may heat, get a better deal? Isn&amp;rsquo;t there something fundamentally wrong somewhere?</description>
