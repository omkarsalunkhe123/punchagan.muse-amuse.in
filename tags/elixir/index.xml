      <description> I refactored the API-diff code, and am pretty happy with what I have right now, and need to add support for diffing Classes. I&amp;rsquo;m considering using Atstroid instead of Python&amp;rsquo;s ast module, since some of the work that I want to do, has already been done for me. With the white-boarding group, we worked on a set of simple exercises for strings and arrays. José Valim&amp;rsquo;s presentation on Elixir was interesting and got me reading up a stuff about concurrency, and related stuff. Thanks!  </description>
