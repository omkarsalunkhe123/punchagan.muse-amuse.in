      <description>Achieve something, I&amp;rsquo;m often reminded,
achieve something, something that&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile.
Don&amp;rsquo;t just kill time, they say,
for, brutally, it shall kill you someday.
Make the best use of time, I tell myself,
for I realize, how I spend my days
is how I&amp;rsquo;m spending my life and
I&amp;rsquo;m going to get just one of it!
But, what is worthwhile, I wonder
everything seems so good one moment
and all meaning vanishes the very next.
I&amp;rsquo;m utterly confused, somebody help!
Pick one from, spoke my brother,
the &amp;lsquo;everything&amp;rsquo; that seems good
and do it right, just, do it right!
Life, as you live through it, shall
teach you to do things that are right
and at the end of it all, you&amp;rsquo;ll
never regret what you&amp;rsquo;ve done
but, only what you couldn&amp;rsquo;t!
Inspired by
 a late-night conversation with a friend Annie Dillard, &amp;ldquo;How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives&amp;rdquo;  </description>
