      <description> Unicode issues: it turned out that (atleast) one of the files had a character that wasn&amp;rsquo;t UTF-8 encoded. I got around it by trying &amp;lsquo;utf-8&amp;rsquo;, if not falling back to &amp;lsquo;iso-8859-1&amp;rsquo;. Now that I think about it, I should fallback to &amp;lsquo;utf-8&amp;rsquo; with replace, if that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work either. I did a little clean up on the way the indexes were stored, to be able to have a getfile, to mimic inspect&amp;rsquo;s API. I also &amp;ldquo;improved&amp;rdquo; the IPython startup script to monkey-patch the source code formatter/colorizer to not break with C modules. The one-on-one with Allison was pretty useful, and I feel a little more relaxed now. I paired with Kyle to get streaming audio working for his OSX app. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t work yet, but we made progress! Hope to get it working today. I spent the late evening trying to refactor some of the code and clean it up. Also, updating the py-clang code to the latest version fixed the issue of unknown cursor kinds. I may present my project in today&amp;rsquo;s presentations!  </description>
