      <description> I spent about an hour in the morning testing out the staging blaggregator instance, and things seemed to work as expected. Side note, I got added as a collaborator on the blaggregator repo! We worked through the first chapter on getting video working, but we mostly ended up just copying code rather than actually understanding/carefully studying it. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how I feel about it, but we got to display fancy stuff. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling like working on any of my &amp;lsquo;old&amp;rsquo;/&amp;lsquo;ongoing&amp;rsquo; projects, and since Mondays don&amp;rsquo;t feel very productive, I worked on writing a couple of simple scripts to create twitter lists of HSers, batch wise.
For the HS API, I just reused some old code I had lying around from my experiments with the OAuth2 API, though I had to tweak it a little bit to be able to actually login, using requests. Something about CSRF tokens seems to have changed.
In the process, I found that twitter&amp;rsquo;s API isn&amp;rsquo;t very pleasant to use. Or may be it&amp;rsquo;s the fact that I was using python twitter client without getting my own client id/key, but the whole experience of dealing with the twitter API wasn&amp;rsquo;t a pleasant one at all!
 Amber, Daria and I also spent about an hour white-boarding some problems from the Cracking the Code Interview book.
 I ended up fixing some minor issues with blaggregator and am hoping that the long pending PR will be merged today.
