      <description>Inspired by this post showing the major flooding events in the US, I created a similar graphic for India. You can find an interactive version here &amp;ndash; hovering over each flooding, shows some more information about the event.
 The graphic uses flooding related data from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory The data for 2017 events is not up-to date. It is very likely that there is some missing data, and some inaccuracies in the data. 1987, for instance, doesn&amp;rsquo;t show the Bihar flood. The flood severity is indicated by the color of each shape Each shape represents the geographic flood extents - based on information obtained from news sources. The data for India map shape is obtained from this topojson collection  It is interesting to look at the severity definitions here &amp;ndash; the extreme class floods, for instance, are defined to be those that have an estimated recurrence interval of over 100 years. In a span of 30 odd years, there are a whole bunch of regions which have been affected by extreme floods. Yet another case in point showing that the climate change shit has really hit the roof!
Code I used ogr2ogr to convert the shape file obtained from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory
ogr2ogr -f geoJSON data/floods.json FloodArchive_region.shp  This file turned out to be about 6MB. I created a file with only Indian floods by parsing the json file.
import json with open(&#39;floods.json&#39;, encoding=&#39;latin-1&#39;) as f: data = json.load(f) india_features = [ feature for feature in data[&#39;features&#39;] if feature[&#39;properties&#39;][&#39;COUNTRY&#39;] == &#39;India&#39; ] data[&#39;features&#39;] = india_features # FIX some names in the data NAME_FIXES = [ (&#39;Tropical Storm K&#39;, &#39;Tropical Storm Komen&#39;), (&#39;Tropical Storm Hudhug&#39;, &#39;Tropical Storm Hudhud&#39;), ] for feature in india_features: for name, fix in NAME_FIXES: cause = feature[&#39;properties&#39;][&#39;MAINCAUSE&#39;] if name in cause: feature[&#39;properties&#39;][&#39;MAINCAUSE&#39;] = cause.replace(name, fix) with open(&#39;india-floods.json&#39;, &#39;w&#39;, encoding=&#39;latin-1&#39;) as f: json.dump(data, f)  The visualization code itself is about a hundred odd lines of d3 code.</description>
