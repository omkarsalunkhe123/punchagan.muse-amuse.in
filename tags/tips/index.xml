      <description>Here are some very generic (and paraphrased) notes from a short talk today, by Deepankar Sharma.
 Whenever you release a new major version, make sure you keep a copy of the whole &amp;ldquo;ecosystem&amp;rdquo; to be able to run it whenever you want. At any point in time, you should be able to run any version of your software. When writing benchmarks/tests/etc., try and ensure that you cover a broad spectrum of test data, to try and replicate the different types of data that users could possibly have. Don&amp;rsquo;t develop applications with modes. Be very careful before you add a new mode to your application, effectively adding one more code path to maintain. (Bonus) Beware of too much extensibility  </description>
