      <description>The Ministry of Home Affairs put out a draft and an RFC for a Geo-spatial bill
 To regulate the acquisition, dissemination, publication and distribution of geospatial information of India which is likely to affect the security, sovereignty and integrity of India.
 Even if you put aside questions about how a vetting process, for &amp;ldquo;dealing with&amp;rdquo; any geospatial information, would help with the said goals, the bill defines geospatial information so broadly that even taking a geo-tagged picture at the Taj mahal or sharing the location of your house for a meal delivery would have you breaking the law.
A group of volunteers made Save the map which has more information on this, along with a draft response that you can send to the Ministry. Please respond before June 2nd, 2016.</description>
