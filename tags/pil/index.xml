      <description> I spent the whole of yesterday just working on the LED-bot. Spent some time cleaning up meta-stuff about the project, making it a real package, adding a setup.py, added LICENSE &amp;amp; AUTHOR files, etc. I found it really frustrating that there&amp;rsquo;s no good/standard way to remove duplication of information between pip&amp;rsquo;s requirements.txt and install_requires We got the bot running on the Beagle Bone, but it turned out to be too slow. After some playing around with trying to get rid of Python for-loops, I was able to use PIL&amp;rsquo;s image.tobytes and some image cropping to get the data to be sent to the LEDs, and it sped up the display quite a bit.  </description>
