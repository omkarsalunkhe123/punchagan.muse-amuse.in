      <description>I really liked this song, गुस्ताख दिल (Gustaakh dil) from the movie English Vinglish. Lyrics by Swanand Kirkire are deep and meaningful as usual!
I was looking for the lyrics on the web, and none of the sites seemed to have got it totally right. Shantanu and I listened to it a bunch of times and think we have got it all right, here.
गुस्ताख दिल
दिल में मुश्किल
मुश्किल में दिल
(मुश्किल में दिल)
गुस्ताख दिल
थोडा संगदिल
थोडा बुज़दिल
दर्द के दर पे
ठहरा है क्यों?
सज़ाएँ सज़ाएँ
ये खुद को क्यों देता नई?
हँसने की धुन में
रोता है क्यों?
सही क्या गलत क्या
कुछ भी ये समझता नहीं
गुस्ताख दिल
दिल में मुश्किल
मुश्किल में दिल
(मुश्किल में दिल)
है बर्फ सी साँसों में
आँखों में धुंआ धुंआ
ये हर पल क्यों खेले है
ग़म का ख़ुशी का जुआं जुआं
ये उम्मीदों भरा
ये खुद से ही डरा
सुलझे धागों में उलझा है क्यों?
सलाहें सलाहें
ये खुद की भी सुनता नहीं
गुस्ताख दिल
दिल में मुश्किल
मुश्किल में दिल
(मुश्किल में दिल)
क्यों बातों ही बातों में
फिसलती है जुबां जुबां
किसी शेह न ठेहेरती है
बेहेक्ति है निगाह निगाह
ये कैसे कब हुआ,
ये कहदो क्यों हुआ
गिरता नहीं तो संभालता है क्यों?
झुकाए झुकाए मग़रूर झुकता नहीं
गुस्ताख दिल
दिल में मुश्किल
मुश्किल में दिल
(मुश्किल में दिल)</description>

      <description>Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve turned 21 today. I&amp;rsquo;d like to write a post today, but this song (by Adam Sandler?) more or less conveys, how I feel.
I&amp;rsquo;d just like to thank everyone, who prays for me to grow up and not just old.
The Happy Birthday Song
Once a year we celebrate
With stupid hats and plastic plates
The fact that you were able to make
Another trip around the sun
And the whole clan gathers round
And gifts and laughter do abound
And we let out a joyful sound
And sing that stupid song
Happy birthday!
Now you&amp;rsquo;re one year older!
Happy birthday!
Your life still isn&amp;rsquo;t over!
Happy birthday!
You did not accomplish much
But you didn&amp;rsquo;t die this year
I guess that&amp;rsquo;s good enough
So let&amp;rsquo;s drink to your fading health
And hope you don&amp;rsquo;t remind yourself
The chance of finding fame and wealth
Decrease with every year
Does it feel like you&amp;rsquo;re doing laps
And eating food and taking naps
And hoping that someday perhaps
Your life will hold some cheer
Happy birthday!
What have you done that matters?
Happy birthday!
You&amp;rsquo;re starting to get fatter
Happy birthday!
It&amp;rsquo;s downhill from now on
Try not to remind yourself
Your best years are all gone
If cryogenics were all free
Then you could live like Walt Disney
And live for all eternity
Inside a block of ice
But instead your time is set
This is the only life you get
And though it hasn&amp;rsquo;t ended yet
Sometimes you wish it might
Happy birthday!
You wish you had more money
Happy birthday!
Your life&amp;rsquo;s so sad it&amp;rsquo;s funny
Happy birthday!
How much more can you take?
But your friends are hungry
So just cut the stupid cake
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday, dear&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I just put this song here&amp;hellip; for
 I just loved this song&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s been composed by A.R.Rahman and I like his music.. In my present state of mind.. this is the Song I best connect to&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve heard to this song.. N times last night.. and for a Dear Friend of mine&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip;..  Pray for me brother
Pray for me brother
Pray for me sister
Are you searchin&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip;
Pray for me brother
Lookin&amp;rsquo; for the answers To all the questions In my life
Will I be alone Will you be there By my side
Is it something he said Is it something he did
I wonder why He is searchin’ For the answers
To stay alive
Could you ever listen Could you ever care
To speak your mind
Only for a minute For only one moment
In time
The joy is around us But show me the love
That we must find
Are you searchin&amp;rsquo; For a reason to be kind, to be kind…
He said&amp;hellip; Pray for me brother
Pray for me brother Pray for me sister
Pray for me brother Say
what you wanna say now
But keep your hearts open
Be what you wanna be now
Let&amp;rsquo;s heal the confusion
Pray for me brother
Don&amp;rsquo;t let me take When you don’t wanna give
Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid Just let me live
Don&amp;rsquo;t let me take When you don’t wanna give
Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid Say what you wanna say now
But keep your hearts open
Be what you wanna be now Let&amp;rsquo;s heal the confusion
Pray for me brother Pray for me brother
I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed ah, brother be dying of poverty
when he down on his knees its only then he prays
And it&amp;rsquo;s a shame ah, brother be dying of ignorance
cos the world is a trip and everybody’s a hypocrite
Need to stop ah , taking a look at the other
I&amp;rsquo;m not ashamed of poverty
need to be making his life better
So think about it, think about it once more
cos life is a blessing and it&amp;rsquo;s not justa show, ah
Round and round the world is spinning around
We need to be singing a prayer, we need to be singing it now
Round and round the world is turning around
We need to be singing a prayer, we need to be singing it now
Need to be feeling the power, need to be feeling the faith
We need to coming together just to win this race
Need to be feeling the power, need to be feeling the faith
We need to coming together just to win this race (twice)
Are you searching for a reason to be kind ?
&amp;ndash; Pray For Me Brother (2007) Composed by A.R.Rahman Lyrics by Blaaze Singers: A.R.Rahman and Blaaze</description>

      <title>Windows©, Doors or Homes!??!</title>

      <description>A couple of days back.. one guy called greenmamba asked me.. &amp;ldquo;Why do you use Linux (GNU/Linux) and not Windows? What is it that makes LinuxGNU/Linux] so special for you?&amp;rdquo; I avoided that question then.. {I was in no mood of answering questions&amp;hellip; Exams had finished just the day before!!} I am trying to answer it now&amp;hellip; greenmamba also told me that Roopesh said, &amp;ldquo;I use it because I can look at the source code. I am allowed to look at how things work and fiddle with the way they work!&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; I knew it immediately that this was not the reason for me.[I rarely looked at source code&amp;hellip; and making changes to it.. haha..] So what is it? I think I can answer this question if I get back to the time when I started using Linux&amp;hellip;[hehe.. not too long ago!! :P]
So how did I start using GNU/Linux? How did &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; first meet? It was during last summer holidays.. that Voods sent me this link &amp;hellip; [I had definitely used GNU/Linux on a few occasions before&amp;hellip; but.. this was when I really began using it&amp;hellip;] and within hours I was a fan of GNU/Linux!\![and Richard M Stallman (RMS)]
So its the &amp;ldquo;philosophy&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; The philosophy of Free Software&amp;hellip; [Free as in Freedom, not as in Free Beer&amp;hellip;(English is a wierd wierd Language&amp;hellip;)]&amp;hellip; The philosophy of Open Source&amp;hellip; that brought me to it&amp;hellip; This song says it the best&amp;hellip;

now I continue to use it.. for a variety of reasons..[they are NOT in the order of their priority/importance]
 Firstly, using Linux gives me a sense of community&amp;hellip; a sense of oneness [this can&amp;rsquo;t happen with Windows.. because you can&amp;rsquo;t share stuff&amp;hellip; :-(] I have begun to hate the concept of Proprietary Software&amp;hellip; can you believe that.. &amp;ldquo;Sharing stuff.. makes us PIRATES!!&amp;rdquo;
 I am a growing fan of the Command Line&amp;hellip; It simply rocks!!
 There&amp;rsquo;s almost no problem of Viruses/Malware.. You simply don&amp;rsquo;t need an Anti-Virus..(that needs to be updated every night.. or u&amp;rsquo;ll have nightmares&amp;hellip;)
 Then there&amp;rsquo;s this wonderful concept of Live-CDs.. {specially Knoppix.. Its absolutely awesome!} It put me(us?) out of soup&amp;hellip; a lotta times&amp;hellip;
 The fiddle factor&amp;hellip; I have just started to fiddle with things(&amp;hellip;source codes&amp;hellip; I added a small feature to my dc-client Microdc2].. the feature of away messages.. it feels gr8! :P)
 One of my best friend is using it too! [you know who&amp;hellip;]
 The Mascot looks cool!! ;) [I liked the GNU mascot too! (It&amp;rsquo;s on my side-bar) ]
 The name &amp;ldquo;LINUX&amp;rdquo;!! [There&amp;rsquo;s so many flavors(Distros) of Linux.. that I can keep trying different ones.. all my life :P.. presently with Slackware!]
 Its Fun!! and I want to use it&amp;hellip;
 and finally&amp;hellip; Windows sucks! [I don&amp;rsquo;t have to use it&amp;hellip; :P]!!
  Value your freedom or you will lose it, teaches history. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t bother us with politics,&amp;rdquo; respond those who don&amp;rsquo;t want to learn. &amp;ndash;Richard Stallman
When you say, &amp;ldquo;I wrote a program that crashed Windows&amp;rdquo;, people just stare at you blankly and say, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I got those with the system, for free&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ndash;Linus Torvalds
&amp;ldquo;What happens when you read some doc and either it doesn&amp;rsquo;t answer your question or is demonstrably wrong? In Linux, you say &amp;ldquo;Linux sucks&amp;rdquo; and go read the code. In Windows/Oracle/etc you say &amp;ldquo;Windows sucks&amp;rdquo; and start banging your head against the wall.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; Denis Vlasenko on linux kernel mailing list
&amp;ldquo;The box said that I needed to have Windows 98 or better&amp;hellip; so I installed Linux.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; LinuxNewbie.org</description>
