      <description>Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve turned 21 today. I&amp;rsquo;d like to write a post today, but this song (by Adam Sandler?) more or less conveys, how I feel.
I&amp;rsquo;d just like to thank everyone, who prays for me to grow up and not just old.
The Happy Birthday Song
Once a year we celebrate
With stupid hats and plastic plates
The fact that you were able to make
Another trip around the sun
And the whole clan gathers round
And gifts and laughter do abound
And we let out a joyful sound
And sing that stupid song
Happy birthday!
Now you&amp;rsquo;re one year older!
Happy birthday!
Your life still isn&amp;rsquo;t over!
Happy birthday!
You did not accomplish much
But you didn&amp;rsquo;t die this year
I guess that&amp;rsquo;s good enough
So let&amp;rsquo;s drink to your fading health
And hope you don&amp;rsquo;t remind yourself
The chance of finding fame and wealth
Decrease with every year
Does it feel like you&amp;rsquo;re doing laps
And eating food and taking naps
And hoping that someday perhaps
Your life will hold some cheer
Happy birthday!
What have you done that matters?
Happy birthday!
You&amp;rsquo;re starting to get fatter
Happy birthday!
It&amp;rsquo;s downhill from now on
Try not to remind yourself
Your best years are all gone
If cryogenics were all free
Then you could live like Walt Disney
And live for all eternity
Inside a block of ice
But instead your time is set
This is the only life you get
And though it hasn&amp;rsquo;t ended yet
Sometimes you wish it might
Happy birthday!
You wish you had more money
Happy birthday!
Your life&amp;rsquo;s so sad it&amp;rsquo;s funny
Happy birthday!
How much more can you take?
But your friends are hungry
So just cut the stupid cake
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday, dear&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>On a day, Wonderful,
&amp;rsquo;m filled with emotion
inexpressible
for, I think of
all that we share.
On a day that&amp;rsquo;s Special,
for the World,
not just yet may be,
my heart rejoices
in the light you fill me with.
On a day, epochal
I just hope, you enjoy
all that the World&amp;rsquo;s given
and celebrate for
all the difference you make
in the World of some.
On this day,
overwhelmed, with lots to convey,
silence, I choose,
for, it speaks louder than words.
I just say,
Happy Birthday, mate.
my 50th post; A poem, I wrote a few weeks ago; A poem or is it doggerel?; Something I wrote for a chum, that gives me courage to write more.</description>

      <title>A Teen, No more.</title>

      <description>As I start this post, the rear-part of my body aches, after a nice thrashing from the hostel junta. Apparently this is my gift on having incremented my account of revolutions, around a big ball of gases. (The total now moves on to 20) [isn&amp;rsquo;t this apparent credit, really a debit?] It was more than compensated for, with a lovely cake though.
I just want to thank all the junta, [relatives and friends and enemies and everyone else], who love me for what I am, even if all they get back is stupidity, imperfection, insincerity, hypocrisy and all sorts of crap. Thanks to everyone who pray for me to grow, up and not just old. Thanks a Million.
A couple of decades through, and still no idea where life&amp;rsquo;s taking me. Isn&amp;rsquo;t LIFE an opportunity that we need to make the most out of?
Just hoping, this year gives me some wisdom, a little courage and a lot more love to make the most of this opportunity.</description>
