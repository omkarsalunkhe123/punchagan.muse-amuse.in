      <description> During the weekend, I read up a lot about HMMs and related stuff. During the day, I tried to start writing code for different parts of the pipeline, and ended up reading about Mel frequency cepstrum related stuff, and wrote a little bit of code. Later, in the afternoon I paired with some of his iOS code, and helped him clean up some of it. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how useful it was for him to pair with me, but &amp;hellip; The day ended with a talk by Jesse at EBay, titled Write an Excellent Programming Blog. I had already read up his blog post, when the talk was announced, and so, most of the content was known, but the Q&amp;amp;A session had some interesting suggestions on how to improve your actual writing.  </description>
